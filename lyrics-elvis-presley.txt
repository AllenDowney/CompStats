Tomorrow night 
Will you remember what you said tonight?
Tomorrow night
Will all thrills be gone?
Tomorrow night
Will it be just another memory,
Or just another lovely song
That's in my full heart to linger on?
Your lips are so tender,
Your heart is beating fast
And you're willing to surrender.
Tell me, darling, will it last?
Tomorrow night
Will you be with me when the moon's bright?
Tomorrow night
Will you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Tomorrow night
Will it be just another memory
Or just another lovely song
That's in my full heart to linger on?
Your lips are so tender,
Your heart is beating fast
And you're willing to surrender.
Tell me, darling, will it last?
Tomorrow night
Will you remember what you said tonight?
Tomorrow night
Will you say those lovely things you said tonight?
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The song of God discloses
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet, the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
We're goin' up, we're goin' down
We're goin' up, down down up
Any way you wanna let it roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You got me doin' what you want me
Oh baby what you want me to do
You got me peepin' you got me hidin'
You got me peep hide hide peep
Any way you wanna let it roll
Yeah yeah yeah
You got me doin what you want me
Baby what you want me to do
(words & music: red west)
(you) where, o where are you
Tell me where are you
Where are the nights we spent together
Where is your promise
That you will leave me never
I've been blue the whole day through
Where o where are you

(On "The Million Dollar Quartet" Elvis sings)
Summertime is past and gone
I'm on my way back home
Summertime is past and and gone
And I'm on my way back home
To see the only one I ever loved
* Now the moon is shining bright
  It lights my pathway tonight
  Back to the only one I ever loved
** Oh I know she waits for me
    Back in old Tenneessee
    She was sent to me from God above
* Repeat
(Solo)
** Repeat
* Repeat
No more do I see the starlight caress your hair
No more feel the tender kisses we used to share
I close my eyes and clearly my heart remembers
A thousand good-byes could never put out the embers
Darling I love you so and my heart forever
Will belong to the memory of the love that we knew before
Please come back to my arms, we belong together
Come to me let's be sweethearts again and then let us part no more.
No more do I feel the touch of your hand on mine
No more see the lovelight making your dark eyes shine
Oh how I wish I never had caused you sorrow
But don't ever say for us there is no tomorrow
Darling I love you so and my heart forever
Will belong to the memory of the love that we knew before
Please come back to my arms, we belong together
Come to me let's be sweethearts again and then let us part no more.
I am the king of the jungle
They call me Tiger Man
I am the king of the jungle
They call me Tiger Man
If you cross my path
You take your own life in your hands
Yeah, I get up on a mountain
And I call my black cat back
Yeah, I get up on a mountain
And I call my black cat back
My black cat comes runnin'
And the hound dogs get way back
Way back, way back, way back
Trace their way back
Yeah, well,  I get up on a mountain
And I call my black cat back
Yeah, well,  I get up on a mountain
And I call my black cat back
My black cat comes runnin'
But the hound dogs trace their way back
Way back, way back, way back
Yeah, well, I get up on a mountain
And I call my black cat back
Yeah, well, I get up on a mountain
And I call my black cat back
But the hound dogs trace their way back
Way back, way back, way back
You say that you love me
And swear it to be true
But if you care to come over here
And make me know it do
Come on now, make me know it
Then go ahead and show it
But if you care to come over here
And make me know it do
You say you've got kisses
And swear that they're brand new
I think that's fine if you ain't lyin'
But make me know it do
Come on now, make me know it
Then go ahead and show it
I think that's fine if you ain't lyin'
But make me know it do
You won't have no trouble proving it to me
Come right along you'll find me
Helpful as can be
You say you wanna hold me
And stick to me like glue
Well hearing's deceiving
And seeing's believing
Make me know it do
Come on now, make me know it
Well go ahead and show it
I say hearing's deceiving
Seeing's believing
Make me know it do
You won't have no trouble proving it to me
Come right along you'll find me
Helpful as can be
You say you wanna hold me
And stick to me like glue
Well hearing's deceiving
And seeing's believing
Make me know it do
Come on now, make me know it
Well go ahead and show it
I say hearing's deceiving
Seeing's believing
Make me know it do
Oh make me know it
Then go ahead and show it
Make me know it
Then go ahead and show it
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same, dear, if you're not here with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
(words & music by lange - duncan)
I thank the lord for everything
When things are going my way
He said to me I will comfort thee
And drive your cares away
He promised me I will walk thee
And drive your cares away
I did not ask for riches
He gave me wealth untold
The moon, the stars, the sun the sky
(are there for you) to behold
I thank the lord for everything
And I count my blessings each day
He came to me when I needed him
I only have to pray
And he'll come to you if you ask him to
He's only a prayer away
Hold me tight the moon's so bright
Tonight the night is right for love
As warmed by one as stars are bright
I hold you oh so close my dear
Things could be that magic kiss
That night of this we've waited for
Oh we could fly right up to the sky
How real it all seems to me
That summer night dream to me
Can't you see that tonight's all right for love
Oh we could fly right up to the sky
How real it all seems to me
That summer night dream to me
Can't you see that tonight's all right for love

ou kiss me darling, a miracle starts
A magic feeling, comes into our hearts
The spell of love began, when we're alone
And we're in, a world of our own
You say you want me, and music I hear
Touch me my darling, and clouds disappear
The sky is bright above, and cares have flown
And we're in, a world of our own
Holding you close, is heaven
Only I know, what it's worth
Knowing you're mine, forever
Is the greatest wonder on earth
Nothing can change it, the magic's begun
When we're together, our hearts become one
I find a happiness, I've never known
When we're in, a world of our own
When we're in...a world of our own
The first Noel the angels did sing
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the king of Israel
And to the Earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the king of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the king of Israel
(words & music by polynesian cultural centre - tepper - bennett)
Drums of the islands you're beating in my heart
You're with me no matter where I roam
If ever I wander if ever we're apart
I know that you will lead me home
If I should journey across the deep blue sea
I'll never forget these coral shores
Drums of the islands I hear you calling me
And I'll return forever yours
I love each valley each grain of sand each hill
The flowers the music of the isles
These are the things I love and always will
Though I may roam ten thousand miles
Oh, oh, I love you so
Uh, uh, can't let you go
Ooh, ooh, don't tell me no
I need your love tonight
Oh, gee, the way you kiss
Sweedee, too good to miss
Wow-whee, want more of this
I need your love tonight
I've been waiting just for tonight
To do some lovin' and hold you tight
Don't tell me baby you gotta go
I got the hifi high and the lights down low
Hey, now, hear what I say
Oh, wow, you better stay
Pow, pow, don't run away
I need your love tonight
Every man has a black star
A black star over his shoulder
And when a man sees his black star
He knows his time, his time has come
Black star don't shine on me, black star
Black star keep behind me, black star
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Black star
When I ride I feel that black star
That black star over my shoulder
So I ride in front of that black star
Never lookin' around, never lookin' around
Black star don't shine on me, black star
Black star keep behind me, black star
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Black star
One fine day I'll see that black star
That black star over my shoulder
And when I see that old black star
I'll know my time, my time has come
Black star don't shine on me, black star
Black star keep behind me, black star
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Black star
I'm on the right track for lots of kissin'
So that old greenback, I won't be missin'
All the greatest things in life are free
Who needs money, not me
Cash or credit, it doesn't matter
Long as my bank books keep growin' fatter
Easy street is my favorite avenue
Who needs money, I do
Just pity all those millionaires they never can relax
Because they're always worryin' about their income tax
Why waste time on high financin', I'd rather spend it on good romancin'
What if my pockets are empty as can be
Who needs money, not me
Tell me about it
Some folks save it, some folks lend it
But as for me I want to spend it
Give me some green and my skies will be blue
Who needs money, I do
Stocks and bonds, they only bore me
Interest holds no interest for me
Who wants to sit in the lap of luxury
Who needs money, not me
When I go to bed at night instead of counting sheep
I start counting dollar bills and then I fall asleep
Making money never thrills me
It's making love that really kills me
What can I lose with my philosophy
Who needs money, not me
What do you want
I want a big yacht, I can cruise in
The kind that girls just can't refuse in
All it takes is a million or two
Who needs money, I do
Any time some gal starts flirtin'
Now that I'm broke I know for certain
She really digs my personality
Tell me, who needs money not me
Poverty's the only thing that money cannot buy
So rich or poor it pays to have M-O-N-E-Y
A gal who's tender, that's what I love
It's legal tender, I want a pile of
Just let my liquid assets overflow
You can't take it with you when you go
So, who needs money
That lovely, lovely money
Who needs money, not me
Young dreams of love, young dreams of love
Young dreams (Young dreams, young dreams
My heart is filled with young dreams 
And I'm longing to
Share them all with you
In my eyes, 
Oh can't you see in my eyes 
That you're the only one who
Can make my young dreams come true
I have young arms
That wanna hold you 
Hold you oh so tight
I have young lips 
That want to kiss you 
Kiss you morning noon and night
Take my hand 
Oh darling take my hand 
And let me make you a part
Of all my young dreams of love
I have young arms
That wanna hold you 
Hold you oh so tight
I have young lips 
That want to kiss you 
Kiss you morning noon and night
Take my hand 
Oh darling take my hand 
And let me make you a part
Of all my young dreams of love
A part of all of my young dreams of love
Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
Haven't ever lost one minute of sleepin'
Worried about the way things might have been
A big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
If you come down to the river
Betcha you're gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give
I said, a big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
If you come down to the river
I betcha you're gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give
I said, a big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
Hold me tight
The moon's so bright
Tonight is so right for love
Now's the time to say
You're the only one
Tonight is so right for love
One by one the stars appear
They twinkle in your eyes
Who'd believe that we'd be here
So near to paradise
This could be the kiss
To unlock heaven's door
That magic hour of bliss
That we both waited for
I love more and more
Oh' we could fly right up to the sky
The things we've been dreaming of
And how real they would seem
A midsummernight's dream
Can't you see that tonight's so right for love
And how real they would seem
A midsummernight's dream
Can't you see that tonight's so right for love
Hold me tight
The moon's so bright
Tonight is so right for love
Somewhere out in empty space, 
long before the human race,
Something stirred,
A vast and timeless source began,
Intelligence was born and then, 
there was the world,
Powers filled the universe, 
matter formed and broke the curse,
Of nothingness,
Love became an ageless soul, 
nature reached her highest goal,
And breathed the breath of life,
Everlasting life.
Well creatures come from out of sight,
Daylight came from in the night, 
and all was good,
Life became a masterplan,
Love produced the perfect man, 
that understood,
The image of the makers word, 
worshipped him with all he had,
But then one day,
From in the depths an evil seed, 
grew and manufactured greed,
That changed the way of life,
Everlasting life,
Oh the loving power looked and saw,
Inside the heart of man a flaw, 
began to grow,
Well, the fires of hell began to burn, 
and so he sent his chosen son,
To let us know,
That love had surely made us all, 
and hate would surely make us fall,
So from the cross,
Well he showed the world that dreadful day,
That love could be the only way, 
or all is lost of life,
Everlasting life,
For life is love,
And love is life.

I'll take you home again, Kathleen
Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
Since first, you were my bonny bride
The roses all have left your cheek
I watch them fade away and die
Your voice is soft whenever you speak
And tears bedim your lovely eye
Oh, I will take you home, Kathleen
To where your heart shall feel no pain
And when the fields are soft and green
I will take you to your home, Kathleen
Seven lonely days and a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night and you were gone
Don't know why you'd run, what you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home
So I'm walking in the rain, thumbin' for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky backroad
I've loved you much too long, my love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing what went wrong
Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes, searchin' for you
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
Showed your photograph to some old gray bearded men
Sitting on a bench outside a general store
They said, "Yes, she's been here", but their memory wasn't clear
Was it yesterday? No, wait the day before
Finally got a ride, with a preacher man who asked
"Where you bound on such a cold, dark afternoon?"
As we drove on through the rain, as he listened I explained
And he left me with a prayer that I'd find you
Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes, searchin' for you
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
...
When the evening shadows fall
And you're wondering who to call
For a little company
There's always me
If your great romance should end
And you're lonesome for a friend
Darling you need never be
There's always me
I don't seem to mind somehow
Playing second fiddle now
Someday you'll want me, dear
And when that day is here
Within my arms you'll come to know
Other loves may come and go
But my love for you will be eternally
Look around and you will see
There's always me
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of streetlights, even stoplights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Soon it will be Christmas day
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me should I cry
Now when you're gone, yet I'll dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
Now and then, there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now
You say that we are through
I'm a fool but I'll love you dear until the day I die
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
Now and then, there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are
I'm a fool but I'll love you dear until the day I die
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
Now and then, there's a fool such as I
(Words & music by Calhoun)
Well get out of that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Get out of that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Well I want my breakfast 'cause I'm a hungry man
I believe you're doin' me wrong and now I know
I believe you're doin' me wrong and now I know
'cause the harder I work the faster my money goes
Well I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you won't do right
To save your doggone soul
I'm like the one-eyed cat peeping in a seafood store
I'm like the one-eyed cat peeping in a seafood store
Well I can look at you till you ain't no child no more
Well I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you won't do right
To save your doggone soul
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
I've got so many women I don't know which way to jump
I said flip flop and fly I don't care if I die
I said flip flop and fly I don't care if I die
I won't ever leave .. Don't ever say goodbye
Oh Blessed Mother we pray to Thee
Thanks for the miracle of Your Rosary
Only You can hold back
Your Holy Son's hand
Long enough for the whole world to understand
Hail Mary full of grace
The Lord is with Thee
Blessed are thou among women
And blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus
Oh Holy Mary dear Mother of God
Please pray for us sinners
Now and at the hour of our death
And give thanks once again
For the miracle of Your Rosary
A well I bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' queer as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
My hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
Please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death!
She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
My tongue get tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this soul of mine
That's to have the girl that I love so fine!
It's now or never, 
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling, 
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late, 
it's now or never
My love won't wait.
When I first saw you 
with your smile so tender
My heart was captured, 
my soul surrendered
I'd spend a lifetime 
waiting for the right time
Now that your near 
the time is here at last.
It's now or never, 
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling, 
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late, 
it's now or never
My love won't wait.
Just like a willow, 
we would cry an ocean
If we lost true love 
and sweet devotion
Your lips excite me, 
let your arms invite me
For who knows when 
we'll meet again this way
It's now or never, 
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling, 
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late, 
it's now or never
My love won't wait.
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
I'll be home for Christmas
(Ooo, oo oo)
You can plan on me
(Ooo, oo oo)
Please have snow and mistletoe
(Ooo)
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
(Ooo, oo oo)
Where a loved light leads
(Ooo, oo oo)
I'll be home for Christmas, ho ho ho yes
(Aaa)
If only in my dreams
  (I'll be home for Christmas)
They say you found somebody new
Whose love will always be true
I don't know what it is to be alone
That's why I dread to know you're gone
Oh, Judy, don't let our sweet love wither and die
Like flowers in the fall
Oh, Judy, don't you know
It's you I love most of all
Oh, please come back
I promise always to be true
Oh, Judy, there'll never be
Anyone else, dear, but you
Oh, please come back
I promise always to be true
Oh, Judy, there'll never be
Anyone else, dear, but you
Oh, Judy, there'll never be
Anyone else, dear, but you
Oh, Judy, there'll never be
Anyone else, dear, but you
If you find your sweetheart in the arms of a friend
That's when your heartaches begin
When dreams of a lifetime must come to an end
That's when your heartaches begin
Love is a thing you'd never can share
When you bring a friend into your love affair
That's the end of your sweetheart
That's the end of your friend
That's when your heartaches begin
If you find your sweetheart
In the arms of your best friend, your brother
That's, that's when your heartaches begin
And you know, when all your dreams
When all your dreams of a lifetime
Must, must all come to an end
Yeah that's, that's when your heartaches begin
Oh, you see love is a thing that
That you never can share
And you know, when you bring a friend
Into your love affair
That's the end of your sweetheart
That's the end of your friend
Well, that's when your heartaches begin
Honey, I love you too much
Need your lovin' too much
Want the thrill of your touch
Gee, I can't hold you too much
You do all the livin'
While I do all the givin'
Cause I love you too much
You spend all my money too much
Have to share you honey, too much
When I want some lovin', you're gone
Don't you know you're treatin' me wrong
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken hearted
Cause I love you too much
Ev'ry time I kiss your sweet lips
I can feel my heart go flip flip
I'm such a fool for your charms
Take me back baby in your arms
Like to hear you sighin' 
Even though I know you're lyin'
Cause I love you too much
Need your lovin' all the time
Need you huggin', please be mine
Need you near me, stay real close
Please, please, hear me, you're the most
Now you got me started 
Don't you leave me broken hearted
Cause I love you too much
The first time I saw you I knew I was hooked on somebody other than me
The first time I held you, your soft lips and blue eyes
Were as far as my eyes could see
Yes here in my arms I knew I had found the reason that I'm living for
And I felt the feeling, such a wonderful feeling
That I'd never felt before
Baby, you're love's been a long time coming
Baby your love's got a hold on me
Baby your love's sure got me humming
Baby your love's been a long time coming
Deep in my heart there's a feeling I never knew
Until I saw a love that was very new
I'm gonna tell everyone what good love can do
Baby, you're love's been a long time coming
Baby your love's got a hold on me
Baby your love's sure got me humming
Baby your love's been a long time coming
Baby, you're love's been a long time coming
Baby your love's got a hold on me
I found my thrill on Blueberry hill
On Blueberry hill where I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry hill
And lingered until my dreams came true
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
Tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry hill
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
Tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry hill
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was a purple gang
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Number 47 said to number 3
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock, Rock, Rock
Sad Sack was sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin' all alone
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake
No one's lookin', now's the chance to make a break"
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks"
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock, dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock, dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

Silent night, holy night.
All is calm, all is bright.
'Round yon virgin mother and child.
Holy infant so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Silent night, holy night.
Shepherds quake at the sight.
Glorious strains from Heaven afar
Heavenly Hosts sing alleluia.
Christ the Saviour is born,
Christ the Saviour is born.
I've been standing on a corner
Since a quarter after seven
I was down to my last cigarette
And the clock in the window
At a quarter to eleven
I was watching all the people
Passing by me going places
Just the loneliest guy in the town
Looking for a friendly smile
But all I see were faces
And then, just like the taste of milk and honey
I found the stranger I've been looking for
Like a wave, my cup of love was overflowing
I knew the stranger in the crowd 
And I would be stranger no more
The love that comes on the corner
At a quarter to eleven
I thought you were to good to be true
All my life I had believed 
That angels only live in heaven
But now, we share the taste of milk and honey
Each day is sweeter than the day before
My cup runned overflowing 
because the stranger in the crowd
And I would be stranger no more
Deep inside, my cup of love was overflowing
I found the stranger I've been looking for
Like a wave, my cup of love was overflowing
I knew the stranger in the crowd
And I would be stranger no more
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm lone
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand, precious Lord
Lead me home
When my way grows drear
Precious Lord, linger near
When my light is almost gone
Hear my cry, hear my call
Hold my hand, lest I fall
Take my hand precious Lord
Lead me home
When the darkness appears
And the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river, I stand
Guide my feet, hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord
Lead me home
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm lone
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord
Lead me home
You don't like crazy music
You don't like rockin' bands
You just wanna go to a movie show
And sit there holdin' hands
You're so square, baby, I don't care
You don't like hotrod racin'
Or drivin' late at night
You just wanna park where it's nice and dark
You just wanna hold me tight
You're so square, baby, I don't care
You don't know any dance steps that are new
No one else could love me like you do, do, do, do
I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square, baby, I don't care
Baby, I don't care, baby, I don't care
Baby, I don't care
I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square, baby, I don't care
Baby, I don't care, baby, I don't care
Care, care, I don't care, care, care
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Well, when the saints go marching in

Home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home
I don't need a mansion on a hill
That overlooks the sea
Anywhere you're with me is home
Maybe I'm a rolling stone
Who won't amount to much
But everything that I hold dear
Is close enough to touch
For home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home
Maybe I'm a rolling stone
Who won't amount to much
But everything that I hold dear
Is close enough to touch
For home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home
You know what it takes,
You've got it, baby.
You are the only one I chose.
Don't leave me here with all these heartaches,
Only you and heaven knows
About my troubles troubles troubles.
When it rains, it really pours...
You shouldn't have took away my loving
You know you thrill me from head to toe.
I got a feeling for you baby
And you're the only one who knows
About my troubles, troubles, troubles.
When it rains, it really pours...
You know what you did to make me love you
You really opened up my nose.
You got what you wanted, now you left me.
That's the way the story goes.
Well, I got troubles, troubles, troubles. 
When it rains, it really pours.
When I said, I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed, but you
And now you've gone away
Don't you know that now you're gone?
And I'm left here on my own
Now I have to follow you
And beg you to come home
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
I can't help but love you
But believe me, I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, oh believe me oh
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me, believe me
Only make believe I love you
Only make believe that you love me
Others find peace of mind in pretending
Couldn't you? Couldn't I? Couldn't we?
Make believe our lips are blending
In a phantom kiss, or two, or three
Might as well make believe I love you
For to tell the truth, I do
Make believe our lips are blending
In a phantom kiss, or two, or three
Might as well make believe I love you
For to tell the truth, I do
For to tell the truth, I do

When I walk through that door
Baby, be polite
You're gonna make me sore
If you don't greet me right
Don't you ever kiss me once
Kiss me twice, treat me nice

It's not fair to tease

If you don't want me to be
Cold as ice, treat me nice

Fingers through my hair

Oh, just because I asked a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Hmm, just because I rang her number by mistake today
You know, she thinks I, I still care
And just because I haunt the same old places
(Same old places)
With a memory I will linger ev'ry everywhere
An' just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
Lord, you know, she thinks I still care
Well, if she's happy thinkin' I still need her
Yeah, let that silly notion bring her cheer
Oh, how could she ever be so foolish
Tell me, where did she get, Lord such an idea?
Oh, Lord
Just because I asked a friend about her
You know, just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because Lord, I saw her and went to pieces
Lord, you know, she thinks I, Lord, still care
You know, she thinks I, I still care
Lord, she thinks I still care
Oh, Lord, she thinks I still care
Fools fallin' in love in a hurry
Fools give their hearts much too soon
Just put in two bars of stardust
Just hang out one silly moon
Oh, they've got their love, torches burning
When they should be playing it cool
I used to laugh but now I'm the same
Take a look at a brand new fool
Fools fall in love just like schoolgirls
Blinded by rose colored dreams
They build their castles on wishes
With only rainbows for beams
Oh, they're making plans for the future
When they should be right back in school
I used to laugh but now I'm the same
Take a look at a brand new fool, all right
They've got their love torches burning
When they should be playing it cool
I used to laugh but now I'm the same
Take a look at a brand new fool
Take a look at a brand new fool
A well I bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' WIRED*  as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
My hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
Please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death!
She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her LIPS* are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this BODY* of mine
That's to have the girl that I love so fine! 
We call on Him whenever storm clouds gather
We call on Him to light our darkest day
Why must it be that only when we're lonely
And hopes are dim, we call on Him
Why don't we call on Him before we lose our way
To count our blessings and thank Him while we may
We call on Him when no-one else will answer
We ask of Him a reason to go on
When our cup of joy becomes a cup of sorrow
Filled to the brim, we call on Him
Why don't we call on Him before we lose our way
To count our blessings and thank Him while we may
I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
Oh girl, you made me love you
Now, now, now your lovin' man has gone
hear what I say
Well, I'm going away, baby
And I won't be back to fall
Well, I'm going away baby
And I won't be back to fall
And if I find me a good girl
I won't, I won't be back at all
Hear what I say, I said
See see rider,
Oh see what you have done
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well I've got a gal, she's as cute as she can be
She's a distant cousin but she's not too distant with me
We'll kiss all night
I'll squeeze her tight
But we're kissin' cousins 'n that's what makes it all right
All right, all right, all right
Oh I've got a girl and she taught me how to live
She can give a lot and she's got a lot to give
We'll kiss all night
I'll squeeze her tight
But we're kissin' cousins 'n that's what makes it all right
All right, all right, all right
Yes we're all cousins, that's what I believe
Because we're children of Adam and Eve
I got a girl and she wants a lot of love
That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of
We'll kiss all night 
I'll squeeze her tight
But we're kissin' cousins 'n that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
We'll be kissin' cousins that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
Yes we're all cousins, that's what I believe
Because we're children of Adam and Eve
I got a girl and she wants a lot of love
That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of
We'll kiss all night
I'll squeeze her tight
But we'll be kissin' cousins 'n that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
We'll be kissin' cousins that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
We'll be kissin' cousins that's what makes it all right
All right, all right, all right
Well, you're right, I'm left, she's gone.
You're right, and I'm left all alone.
Well, you tried to tell me so,
But how was I to know 
That she was not the one for me?
You told me all along,
You're right, our love was so wrong.
But now I changed my mind,
Because she broke the ties that bind, 
And I know that she never cared for me.
Well, I thought I knew just what she'd do,
I guess I'm not so smart.
Oh, you tried to tell me along she'd only break my heart.
I'm left, you're right, she's gone.
You're right, and I'm left all alone.
Well, she's gone I know not where,
But now I just don't care.
For now I'm falling for you.
If you'll forgive me now,
I'll make it up somehow.
So happy we will be,
In a home just for three,
And I'll soon forget her,
Now I know.
Well, I thought I knew just what she'd do,
I guess I'm not so smart.
You tried to tell me all along,
She'd only break my heart.
Well, you're right, I'm left, she's gone.
You're right, and I'm left all alone.
Well, she's gone, I know not where,
But now I just don't care,
For now I've fallen for you.
Where do you come from?
Tell me who you are
Do you come from another world
Or from some distant star?
Where do you come from?
Are you what you seem?
Are you real,
Are you standing there,
Or is it just a dream?
Tell me more about yourself
Do you feel the way I feel?
Are you just a vision,
Or are you really real?
Where do you come from?
Angel won't you say?
Tell me all that there is to know
And tell me that you'll stay.
Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound
That saved a wreck like me
I once was lost, though now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Then when, when we first begun
Too many ages false and spent
I have already hung
This face and flock He saved us by
His endless grace will leave me whole
Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound
To save a wreck like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
This is the moment I've waited for
I can hear my heart singing
Soon bells will be ringing
This is the moment of sweet aloha
I will love you longer than forever
Promise me that you will leave me never
Here and now dear, all my love I vow dear
Promise me that you will leave me never
I will love you longer than forever
U a, si la
Pa a ia me o e
Ko a lo ha ma ka mea e i po
Ka 'u ia e le i a e ne i la
Now that we are one, clouds won't hide the sun
Blue skies of Hawaii smile on this, our wedding day
I do love you with all my heart
Pedro the bull was a killer
King of the bullfighter ringer
He'd wipe up the floor with each brave matador
And have matador stew for his dinner
He heard the crowd shouting "OlÃÂ©"
But he met his master that day
The bullfighter was a lady
And it was true love at first sight
Her red cape was waving but Pedro was shaking (or shaving?)
He wanted to date her that night
OlÃÂ©
Pedro the bull he was smitten
First time the love bug had bitten
He once was a mad bull, a wild and a bad bull
But now he was mild as a kitten
The people were starting to hiss
But Pedro just wanted to kiss
The bullfighter was a lady
And Pedro he liked what he saw
He floated on air with a rose in his hair
As he waltzed with that sweet matador
His fate was a bad one, his tale is a sad one
It's hanging right over her door
OlÃÂ©!
Get up in the mornin' feelin' might weak
A tossin' and a turnin' well, I had ain't no sleep
Oh baby, what road's our love taking?
To romance or heartbreaking'
Won't you say which way you're gonna go
I gotta know, gotta know, gotta know
Nine and nine make fourteen, four and four make nine
The clock is strikin' thirteen I think I lost my mind
You know it's gettin' aggravatin'
How long can I keep waitin'
Tell me if you love me yes or no,
I gotta know, gotta know, gotta know
Oh, how much I need you
Have pity on this heart of mine
Well, if you need and want me too,
I'll be your one and only till the end of time
Saw the fortune teller, had my fortune read
She sent me to the doctor, who sent me straight to bed
He said I'm lonesome and I'm lovesick
I've got my mind on lipstick
Will you kiss away my cares and woe?
I gotta know, gotta know, gotta know
I don't want much
Just want a little bit
Don't want it all
Just a little bit
Give me an eeny weeny bit
A teeny weeny bit of your love
Turn your lamps down low
Slip me a kiss
Turn your lights down low
I won't let you resist
I want an eeny weeny bit
A teeny weeny bit of your love
Early in the mornin'
Well just a little bit
Around midnight
Just a little bit
I want an eeny weeny bit
A teeny weeny bit of your love
Walk with me
Just a little bit
I said talk to me
Just a little bit
I want an eeny weeny bit
A teeny weeny bit of your love
I want you to remember
To say that you'll be mine
Say you'll never leave me
Till the end of time
I want an eeny weeny bit
A teeny weeny bit of your love
I want an eeny weeny bit
A teeny weeny bit of your love
When her motor's warm, and she's purrin' sweet
Buddy let me warn ya', you're on a one-way street
She'll crowd ya' close, spin your wheels
Then you're gonna know how it feels
To spinout, yeah spinout

She'll get your high and goin' fast
Then she'll let you run out of gas
So spinout, yeah spinout

Scoot before you lose control

To flag you down, that's her goal
Scoot before you lose control
And spinout, spinout, spinout, alright
Flip, flop with kay-eye (?)
What a cutie pie I see
Oops shoopa doo-wah
Lips of honey that's for me 
Shim sham shimmie
I might forget you baby, there's no doubt
I saw you standing 'gainst the wall 
I whistled and I gave my all 
Now don't tell me you don't fall
For that wolf call
Just a little kiss'll put me in a whirl
I'll never whistle dearie at another girl
You love me well we'll have a ball 
Why do you try to stall
Now don't tell me you don't fall
For that wolf call
For that wolf call
For that wolf call
First time I fell in love
I fell in love with you
First time I dared to dream
My only dream came true
Must be beginner's luck
To wish upon a star
That opened up my eyes
And there you are
I wave no magic wand
I own no lucky charms
How then can I explain
An angel in my arms
Must be beginner's luck
What else can it be
When someone wonderful as you
Loves me
Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
Quiet thoughts come floating down and settle softly to the ground
Like golden autumn leaves around my feet
I touched them and they burst apart with sweet memories
Sweet memories
Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you
Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
Memories, memories
Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you
Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
Memories, memories, sweet memories, memories
I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you?
Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you?
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away
Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
And I'm asking you darling
How's the world treating you?
(Words & music by Batchelor - Roberts)
A poor man wants the oyster
A rich man wants the pearl
But the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
Come on let's sing, sing brother sing
'Cos the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
The rich man wants the princess
The poor man just wants a girl
But the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
Come on let's sing, sing brother sing
'Cos the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
A poor man wants to be a rich man
A rich man wants to be a king
But the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
Come on let's sing, sing brother sing
'Cos the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
Come on let's sing, sing brother sing
'Cos the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
Of the whole wide world
Of the whole wide world

Soldier boy why feel blue
Don't you believe that she will be true
It's written in the book
That she was meant for only you
Soldier boy tell me why do you cry
When you return she'll rush to your side
It's written in the book
That she was meant for only you
So prove your love is true
She'll be there to say "I do"
And if you go o'er sea or land
She'll make you understand
While you're gone oh try to believe
Her love for you is really for real
It's written in the book
That she was meant for only you
So prove your love is true
She'll be there to say "I do"
And if you go o'er sea or land
She'll make you understand
While you're gone oh try to believe
Her love for you is really for real
It's written in the book
That she was meant for only you
(Words & music by Evans - Tobias)
Blue river, it can't be found on any map that I know
But it's the place where lonely lovers all go
To cry their tears, blue river
It winds along a path of heartache and pain
Of broken dreams from lovin' someone in vain
Like I loved you, and baby I still do
I held you so tight
You were out of my sight
I'm feelin' so low
But I gotta go
Blue river because you never really cared about me
From now on baby that's where I'm gonna be
Cryin' over you, by the river of blue
I am not a wise man neither am I a fool
But what I am, the way the good Lord made me
Though I need you more than you may ever understand
I can't wear a face that will betray me
Oh, if you're gonna love me, love the life I lead
Need the things I need, don't try to change me
If you're gonna take me, take me for what I am
I can't be another man, I can't be free
'Cos the life I lead is the life I lead
Money in my pocket never seems to last too long
I've gambled on the way and drowned my sorrows
Though God knows, I can't pretend it's better on my own
I can't promise you a new tomorrow
Oh, if you're gonna love me, love the life I lead
Need the things I need, don't try to change me
If you're gonna take me, take me for what I am
I can't be another man, I can't be free
'Cos the life I lead is the life I lead
Oh, if you're gonna love me, love the life I lead
Need the things I need, don't try to change me
If you're gonna take me, take me for what I am
I can't be another man, I can't be free
'Cos the life I lead is the life I lead
If you're gonna love me, love the life I lead
Need the things I need, don't try to change me
If you're gonna take me, take me for what I am
I can't be another man, I can't be free
'Cos the life I
What's she really like
The girl that you see me with
What's she really like
The one I'm so dreamy with
Well, let me tell you she's wonderful
She's marvelous and she's mine
Told here that her lips, her lips are so thrillable
I can't describe her kiss in words of one syllable
She's even more than desirable
And what's moreable she's mine
What's she really like
The girl I go on about
What's she really like
The one I'm so mad about
All I can say, she's wonderful
She's marvelous and she's mine
You're asking if she loves me
Well, you don't know the half
You're wondering if she'll leave me
Ha, ha, ha, don't make me laugh
What's she really like
The girl I go on about
What's she really like
The one I'm so gone about
All I can say, she's wonderful
She's marvelous and she's mine
Oh, Rock of ages, hide Thou me
There is no other refuge
Can save but thee
Through this old world
I've wandered so far, far from thee
Then I cry
Ooh, rock of ages
Hide thou me
Hide thou me
Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a lot of dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
But when it does your heart will know
You're gonna be a beautiful woman
Because you're such a beautiful child
And when you start to bloom 
Just like a rose in June
I bet the schoolboys all go wild, but right now
Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a few dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
When it does your heart will know
Your life's still a lollipop heaven
Your teddy bear's at the foot of your bed
The little boy next door who only makes you sore
Is gonna some day turn your head but right now
Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a few dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
When it does your heart will know
You're gonna grow over night into a lady
With a devastatingly smile ???
And then a lucky guy will see you
And wanna walk you down the aisle, but meanwhile
Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a few dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
When it does your heart will know
When it does your heart will know
When it does your heart will know
(Now and then there's a fool such as I)
Pardon me, if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me should I cry
When you're gone yet I dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I'm a fool, but I love you dear until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I
(Now and then there's a fool such as I)
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I'm a fool, but I love you dear until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as I

Some like their women short, some like them tall
I'll take them any size 'cause I love them all
I'm just wild about smorgasbord
I got a cravin' for smorgasbord
A little kiss here, a little kiss there
That's smorgasbord
Mmm
Some take just apple pie, some take just cake
I'll take the dish I please, please the dish I take
I'm just wild about smorgasbord
I got a cravin' for smorgasbord
A little kiss here, a little kiss there
That's smorgasbord
Mmm
Some like just southern belles, they got a one track mind
I go for all the belles except the wedding kind
I'm just wild about smorgasbord
I got a cravin' for smorgasbord
A little kiss here, a little kiss there
That's smorgasbord
Some like their women short, some like them tall
I'll take them any size 'cause I love them all, Mmm
Some take just apple pie, some take just cake
I'll take the dish I please, please the dish I take
These long lonely evenings
Here I am on the phone
Wondering if she will call
She said she would write me
'Cause she knows I'm alone
But I hear nothing at all
I'm waiting for a word of love from Sylvia. 
You think she'd never heard of love my Sylvia,
But when I'm with her Lord, I forgive her
'Cause she's more than the whole world to me
There's nothing like a word of love from Sylvia
The only one I'm thinking of is Sylvia
Feeling so sad now, I'll be so glad now
If I just had my Sylvia with me
That old weepin' willow
Seems to whisper her name
Why did she go away
The tears on my pillow
They're not hard to explain
There's nothing else I can say
I'm waiting for a word of love from Sylvia. 
You think she'd never heard of love my Sylvia,
But when I'm with her Lord, I forgive her
'Cause she's more than the whole world to me
There's nothing in the world like Sylvia
The only one I'm thinking of is Sylvia
Feeling so sad now, I'll be so glad now
If I just had my Sylvia with me
Show me a girl with a dimple on her cheek
Butter melts in her mouth when she opens it to speak
Show me a girl who is acting so refined
And I'll show you a girl with one thing on her mind
So I say, "You know what?"
She says, "What?", I say, "What?
Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"
"For you've got what it takes
And it takes what you've got
But I'm not the marrying kind"
"Don't kiss me, don't claw me
Don't pet me, don't paw me
I won't leave my freedom behind"
So I say, "You know what?"
She says, "What?", I say, "What?
Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"
"You know what?", She says, "What?"
I say, "What? Thanks a lot
But I'm not the marrying kind"
"Don't kiss me, don't claw me
Don't pet me, don't paw me
And I won't leave my freedom behind"
So I say, "You know what?"
She says, "What?", I say, "What?
Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"
"I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
Now you've got what I'm not
I'm not the marrying kind"
"Oh, I'm not the marrying kind
Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"

I've got those hup, two, three, four 
occupation G.I. Blues
From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes
And if I don't go stateside soon
I'm gonna blow my fuse
We get hasenpfeffer

And they don't give the Purple Heart

I've got those hup, two, three, four

From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes
And if I don't go stateside soon
I'm gonna blow my fuse
The frauleins are pretty as flowers
But we can't make a pass
The frauleins are pretty as flowers
But we can't make a pass
Cause they're all wearin' signs saying:
"Keepen sie off the grass"
I've got those hup, two, three, four 
occupation G.I. Blues
From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes
And if I don't go stateside soon
I'm gonna blow my fuse
I'm sorry now girl, but I must leave you
There's something deep inside my soul keeps calling me
The winter wind girl, will not deceive you
And in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
You'll think of me 
You'll see me coming, you'll see me going
Don't ask me why, I'm just the kind needs to be free
Just like that outlaw wind keeps on a-blowin'
Yeah, in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
You'll think of me 
Now I know you loved me just like I wanted
I know you'd follow me across an endless sea
But baby I've got a heart that's haunted
Yeah, in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
You'll think of me
Ah but you should know girl that I'll be crying
Out on that lonely road where not a soul can see
I'll shed my tears for a love that's dying
Yeah, in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
You'll think of me
The summer sun girl will bring a stranger
And he'll be better to you than I used to be
And when he takes you into his arms girl
Well, in your warm and loving bed, you won't think of me, no, no
You won't think of me 
Then in your warm and loving bed, you won't think of me, no, no
You won't think of me
Treat me, treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel
Oh yeah, but love me
Break my faithful heart
Tear it all apart
Yeah, but love me
If you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh, oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only
I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart
Beating close to mine
If you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh, oh so lonely
Beggin' on my knees
All I ask is please, please love me
Oh yeah
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she moves me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how?
Somewhere in her smile she knows
All I gotta do is think about her
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how?
You're asking me will our love grow?
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she moves me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how?
You're asking me will our love grow?
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she moves me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how?
I'm just a roustabout
Shifted from town to town
No job can hold me down, I'm just a knock-around guy
There's a lot of space beneath that sky
Till I find my place there's no doubt...
I'll be a rovin' roustabout
Call me the carefree kind
I wander with the breeze
My mind and heart's at ease
Doing what pleases me best
Gotta keep-a movin' east or west
Till I find my place there's no doubt
I'll be a rovin' roustabout
And even if a pretty girl, should catch my eye
I'll give her a quick "hello", and a fast goodbye
I'll go the way I want
Driftin' just like the sand
Doin' what job I can
Changing my plans as I choose
Long as I keep happy I can't lose
Till I find my place there's no doubt
I'll be a rovin' roustabout
I'll be a rovin' roustabout...I'll be a rovin' roustabout
I'll be a rovin' roustabout..rovin', rovin' roustabout....

Lordy, only believe, only believe
All things are possible if you'll only believe
My Lordy, only believe, yes, only believe
All things are possible, if you'll only believe
I met God one morning, my soul feeling bad
Heart heavy laden, I felt [Incomprehensible] doubt ahead
Well, He lifted all my burdens
Yeah, right now I'm feeling glad
All things are possible, if you'll only believe
I believe, yeah, I believe
All things are possible, if you'll only believe
If you got a problem, I don't care what it is
If you need a hand, I can assure you this
I can help, I got two strong arms and I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good, let me help
It's a fact that people get lonely, it ain't nothing new
But a woman like you, baby, should never have the blues
Let me help, have a laugh on me, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good, let me help
When I go to sleep at night, you're always a part of my dream
Holding me tight, telling me everything I want to hear

Are you sincere when you say "I love you"
Are you sincere when you say you love me too
And are you really mine every day, all the time
I've gotta know which way to go
Will our love grow, are you sincere
Are you sincere when you say "I love you"
Honey, are you sincere when you say you love me too
And are you really mine every day, all the time
I've gotta know which way to go
Will our love grow, are you sincere
Ev'rytime you kiss me
I'm still not certain that you love me
Ev'ry time you hold me
I'm still not certain that you care
Though you keep on saying
you really, really, really love me
do you speak the same words
To someone else when I'm not there
Suspicion torments my heart
Suspicion keeps us apart
Suspicion why torture me
Ev'rytime you call me
and tell me we should meet tomorrow
I can't help but think that
you're meeting someone else tonight
Why should our romance just 
keep on causing me such sorrow?
Why am I so doubtful 
whenever you're out of sight?
Darling, if you love me, 
I beg you wait a little longer
Wait until I drive all
these foolish fears out of my mind
How I hope and pray that 
our love will keep on growing stronger
Maybe I'm suspicious 
'cause true love is so hard to find
Aloha-oe, aloha-oe,
e ke onaona noho i ka lipo
One fond embrace a ho'i a e au
Until we meet again
Until we meet again
You never close your eyes
Anymore when I kiss your lips
There's no tenderness
Like before in you fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it
Baby, baby I know it
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Oh, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone
There's no tenderness in your eyes
When I reach out for you
Girl, you're starting to criticize
Every little thing I do
It makes me just feel like crying
'Cause baby, something beautiful's dying
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Oh, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Baby, baby, I get down on my knees for you [incomprehensible]
If you would only love me like you used to do
We had a love, love, lovin' affair every day
Oh, don't, don't, don't, don't take it away
Listen to me, talkin' to you
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
Oh, that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on
Known only to Him are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds
But I know who holds the future
It's a secret known only to Him
In this world of fear and doubt
On my knees I ask the question
Why a lonely, heavy cross I must bear?
Then He tells me in my prayer
It's because I am trustworthy
He gives me strength far more than my share
Known only to Him are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds
But I know who holds the future
It's a secret known only to Him
I said, "Take it easy, baby
I worked all day and my feet feel just like lead
You got my shirt tails flyin' all over the place
And the sweat poppin' out of my head"
She said, "Hey, bossa nova baby
Keep on workin' for this ain't no time to quit"
She said, "Go, bossa nova baby keep on dancin'
I'm about to have myself a fit"
Bossa nova, bossa nova
I said, "Hey little mama, let's sit down
Have a drink and dig the band"
She said, "Drink, drink, drink oh, fiddle-de-dink
I can dance with a drink in my hand"
She said, "Hey bossa nova baby
Keep on workin' for this ain't no time to drink"
She said, "Go bossa nova baby
Keep on dancin', 'cause I ain't got time to think"
Bossa nova, bossa nova
I said, "Come on baby, it's hot in here
And it's oh so cool outside
If you lend me a dollar, I can buy some gas
And we can go for a little ride"
She said, "Hey bossa nova baby
Keep on workin' for I ain't got time for that"
She said, "Go bossa nova baby
Keep on dancin' or I'll find myself another cat"
Bossa nova, bossa nova
Bossa nova, bossa nova
Bossa nova, bossa nova
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile could bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you're gone
'Cause that could bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory
Let's start a brand new story now, my love
Right now there'll be no other time
And I can show you all my love
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say
It's only words and words are all I have
To take your heart away
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say
It's only words and words are all I have
To steal your heart away
It's only words and words are all I have
To steal your heart away
It's only words and words are all I have
To steal your heart away, heart away, ya baby
It's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky
It's just impossible
It's impossible to ask a baby not to cry
It's just impossible
Can I hold you closer to me?
And not feel you going through me
But the second that I never think of you?
Oh, how impossible
Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever ask for more?
It's just impossible
And tomorrow should you ask me for the world?
Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul
And not regret it for to live without your love
Is just impossible
Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever ask for more?
It's just impossible
And tomorrow, should you ask me for the world?
Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul
And not regret it for to live without your love
Is just impossible
(Impossible)
Oh, impossible
(Impossible)
Impossible

Mama she done told me, papa done told me too
"Son, that gal you're foolin' with, she ain't
No good for you" but that's alright, that's alright
That's alright now mama, anyway you do
I'm leaving town, baby, I'm leaving town for sure
Well, then you won't be bothered with me hanging
'Round your door, well, that's alright, that's alright
That's alright now mama, anyway you do
Take me to the fair
Take me to the fair, don't know anywhere
I would rather be
Let's, go to the fair
We'll walk hand in hand, through Tomorrow Land
Only you and me
*chorus
I wanna see everything, do everything
While we're doin' it all
I'll buy the peanuts and popcorn
We'll have us a ball
You can spend my pay
Crush me in the crowds, I'll be in the clouds
Honey I don't care
Take me there by sleigh
Go, let's get a bite, anywhere you like
But take me to the fair
I wanna see everything, do everything
While we're doin' it all
I'll buy the peanuts and popcorn
We'll have us a ball
Take me there by sleigh
Go, let's have a bite, anywhere you like
But take me to the fair
Take me to the fair, Take me to the fair
Take me to the fair
When You're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all
I'm on your site, oh, When times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water,
I will lay me down,
Oh, like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When you're down and out, when you're on the streets
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you
I'll take your part when the darkness falls and pain is all around
Yes, like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Oh, like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on, silver girl, sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you need a friend,
I'm sailing right behind
Yes, like a bridge over troubled water
I, I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will easy your mind
This proud wild land where the wind blows free
Has always been a part of me
It's in my blood, I just can't get it out
For a hundred miles a man can see
And be about as wild as he wants to be
If he feels like shouting all he's gotta do is shout
Where the purple mountains reach up high
And look like they're gonna touch the sky
Where the canyon walls have stood for a million years
Where the days are hot, the nights are cold
The desert sand looks just like gold
These trails were carved in sweat and blood and tears
Where the painted desert as you pass by
Looks like a rainbow in the sky
The cactus blooms in the early morning sun
Where the nightwings sing and eagles fly
The clouds paint pictures in the sky
The coyotes howl tells you when the day is done
I'm coming home, this time I'm gonna stay
I'm coming home and I ain't never goin' away
My feet are itching to get back home
I've had the desert fever since I've been gone
I need some loving so bad that I can't see
When a woman looks a man in the eye
You know it takes a man to satisfy
Thinking about them girls is killing me
I'm going home, going home
Going home, I'm going home
Going home, going home
Going home
Ask me if I wanted to caress you
And I'd confess
Ask me if I'm longing to possess you
I'll answer yes
Now that we're together
I could hold you close forever
And I swear that I would never let you go
There's no question that I care more than you
Love me darling, just be mine completely
And there's nothing I won't do if you
Just ask me
The way she held your hand,
The little things you planned
Her memory is with you yet
That's someone you never forget
When she is far away
You'll think of her each day
And you know she'll wait for you
That's someone you never forget
Others may pass your way
And let you think their love is true
But you know that they'll never replace
The one that waits for you
The wonderful world of Christmas
Is a wonderful world to behold
The wonderful world of Christmas
Was made for the young and the old
Smile and good cheer of each neighbor
And children with cheeks all aglow
So, warm is this Christmassy feeling
With the tree tops all locked up with snow
Listen to those wondrous bells
And you'll hear them say
Open up your hearts to all on this holyday
The wonderful world of Christmas
Is a joy from the moment it starts
The wonderful world of Christmas
Shall remain everyday in our hearts
  (Open up your hearts to all, to the wonderful world of Christmas)
I woke up this morning and I tried to call you, mmm
But you weren't there and that put me in despair
So I thought that maybe I could lose my mind
In the countryside so I went for a ride
But I never stopped thinking about you
Found myself wishing you were there
Just to be with me, feel the breeze
Sun didn't smile I didn't care
I decided to try just one more time
To let you know I really love you so
Before I arrived I saw you go away
With another guy, a tear filled my eye
But I never stopped thinking about you
Found myself wishing you were there
Just to be with me, feel the breeze
Sun didn't smile I didn't care
A long time has past since that day I cried
Life is fine and I'm doin' fine
When I'm at home and I feel all alone
Well I think of you, try to get a message through
But I never stopped thinking about you
Found myself wishing you were there
Just to be with me, feel the breeze
Sun didn't smile I didn't care
Stepping through the sinking sand
To the cross of Calvary
Mm, let it be my prayer, dear Lord, each day
To help me do the best I can
For there is no friend on whom I can depend
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand ...
Oh, yes, I need Thee every hour
Through the this pilgrims land
Protect me by thy saving power
Please, hear my feeble plea
Oh, hoh, Lord, please, tell me 
I kneel in prayer, I try to meet you there
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand, hold my hand.
I can't conceal the tender feeling
Now that you are close to me
I look at you with tender feeling
And can't help kiss you tenderly
I offer you a true devotion
All life through my love I vow
For this is real, this sweet emotion
This tender feeling I have now
Somehow I knew from the moment our lips first met
You'd be the girl I could never forget
No other love could be appealing
I loved you right from the start
And with each kiss I'll keep revealing
The tender feeling in my heart
It hurts me to see him treat you the way he does
It hurts me to see sit and cry
When I know I could be so true
If I had someone like you
It hurts me to see those tears in your eyes
The whole town is talking, they're callin' you a fool
For listening to his same old lies
And when I know I could be so true
If I had someone like you
It hurts me to see the way he makes you cry
You love him too much, you're too blind to see
He's only playing a game
But he's never loved you
He never will
And darling, don't you know he will never change
Oh, I know he never will set you free
Because he's just that kind of guy
But if you ever tell him you're through
I'll be waiting for you
Waiting to hold you so tight
Waiting to kiss you goodnight
Yes, darling, if I had someone like you
Roy Bennett, Sid Tepper
I can see you now living like a queen
In a house that has everything, everything but love
Crystal chandeliers, chauffeured limousines
Yes youll really have everything, everything but love
I see diamonds, sables, sapphires and pearls
And as the picture clears
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone
Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care
Than a house that has everything, everything but love
I see diamonds, sables, sapphires and pearls
And as the picture clears
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone
Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care
Than a house that has everything, everything but love
Than a house that has everything, everything but love 
 
When we kiss my heart's on fire
Burning with a strange desire
And I know, each time I kiss you
That your heart's on fire too
So, my darling, please surrender
All your love so warm and tender
Let me hold you in my arms, dear
While the moon shines bright above
All the stars will tell the story
Of our love and all its glory
Let us take this night of magic
And make it a night of love
Won't you please surrender to me
Your lips, your arms, your heart, dear
Be mine forever
Be mine tonight
(words & music by ray/jackson)
Hearts made of stone will never brake
'cause your love is never there, they just don't care
You can ask and plea, please, please, please work
And all your love is there to stay
These hearts of stone will cause you pain
Although you love there has stopped just the same
You can ask and plea, please, please, please work
And all your love is there to stay
But they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Cause they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You daddy know, I thought I knew hearts made of stone

Your losing interest in me and it's showin'
It ain't no big thing but it's growin'
The pain of heartbreak I've just started knowin'
Well, it ain't no big thing but it's growin'
Every day the hurt grows bigger than before
But I'll pretend I don't know this
But If I can hold you one day more
You've got the look of someone who's goin'
You're gonna leave me and it's showin'
A little tear I can feel start to flow
It ain't no big thing but it's growin'
Well every day the hurt grows bigger than before 
But I'll pretend I don't know this
Well, if I can hold you one day more
You've got the look of someone who's goin'
Well, you're gonna leave me and it's showin'
A little tear I can feel start to flow
Well it ain't no big thing but it's growing
No, it ain't no big thing but it's growing
Every time you look at me
I,m as helpless as can be
I become a puppet on a string
You can do 'most anything to me
All you do is touch my hand
And your wish is my command
I become a puppet on a string
You can do 'most anything to me
If you really love me
Darling please be kind
I offer you the truest love
That you will ever find
Take my heart and please be fair
Handle it with loving care
For I'm just a puppet on a string
You can do 'most anything to me
If you really love me
Darling please be kind
I offer you the truest love
That you will ever find
Take my heart and please be fair
Handle it with loving care
For I'm just a puppet on a string
You can do 'most anything to me
You can do 'most anything to me
Well a hundred years from now I won't be crying
A hundred years from now I won't be blue
My heart will have to forget that we ever met
But I won't care a hundred years from now
I'll never forget sweetheart the night you told me
That you could Live without my love somehow
That's all in the past I knew it wouldn't last
But I won't care a hundred years from now
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do.
As I was motivatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a coup de ville.
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road,
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford.
The cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five,
She's bumper to bumber rollin' side by side.
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do.
The cadillac moved to a hundred and four
got hot and wouldn't do no more
It got cloudy and started to rain
Tooted my horn in the passing lane
The rain water blowin all under my hood
I knew that was doin' my motor no good
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do.
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do.
The motor cooled down, the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound.
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead.
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Mabellene at the top of the hill.
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do.
You've started back doing the things you used to do.
Softly
I will leave you
Softly
For my heart would break
If you should wake
And see me go
So I leave you
Softly
Long before you miss me
Long before your arms
Can beg me stay
For one more hour
Or one more day
After all the years
I can't bear the tears
To fall
So softly
As I leave you there
Softly
Long before you kiss me
Long before your arms
Can beg me stay
For one more hour
Of one more day
After all the years
I can't bear the tears
To fall
So softly
As I leave you there
As I leave you there
As I leave you there
(words & music by ernest tubb - carl story)
I'm with a crowd but oh so alone
I still have the picture you sent me
And you signed it with love you recall
And the one of me that you wanted
Is now hanging face to the wall
At night I'm never alone
I'm afraid that I'll weaken and phone
And I'm afraid that you will be gone
I'm with a crowd but oh so alone
Ooh yes we're comin' in loaded, Ooh yes we're comin' in loaded
I'll hold the boat steady brother like a rock
Full speed a head until we hit the dock
We're heading for home, the fishing was great
We're comin' in loaded 'cause we're all out of bait
Well, well, well, well, well
Oh well now yeah!
We gottem packed to the water-line
Some got away but the catch was fine
Never saw such big ones, m'man oh man,
We're comin' in loaded just as fast as we can
Well, well, well, well, well
Oh well now yeah!
I'm gonna see my baby soon as I get back
Knock on the door with my pockets packed
She'll look at me well she can't say no
We're comin' in loaded so come on let's go
Well, well, well, well, well
Oh well now yeah!
Oh well now yeah!
Yeah! we're comin' in loaded
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you
There's a moon that's big and bright in the milky way tonight
But the way you act you never would know it's there
So baby, time's a wasting
A lot of kisses I ain't been tasting
I don't know about you but I'm gonna get my share
Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you
There's a balmy little breeze
That's whistling through the trees
And it's telling you to pitch a little woo with me
Why don't you take a listen
You'll never know what you've been missing
Cuddle up a little closer and be my little honey bee
Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you
You're the prettiest thing I've seen
But you treat me so doggone mean
Ain't you got no heart, I'm dying to hold you near
Why do you keep me waiting
Why don't you start co-operating
And the things I say are things you want to hear
Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you
You came when I was happy in your sunshine
I grew to love you more each passing day
Before too long I'd filled my world around you
Yeah and I prayed you loved enough of me to stay
If you love me let me know, if you don't let me go
I can't take another minute of the day without you near
If you love me let it be, if you don't set me free
Take the chains away that keep me loving you
The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says hello it's good to see you
Any time I turn around and find you there
It's this and so much more that makes me love you
What else can I do to make you see, long long
You know you'll have whatever's mine to give you
Yeah but a love affair for one can never be
If you love me let me know, if you don't let me go
I can't take another minute of the day without you near
If you love me let it be, if you don't set me free
Take the chains away that keep me loving you
Take the chains away that keep me loving you
When a boy like me meets a girl like you
Then I must believe wishes come true
I just look at you and I touch your hand
And this ordinary world becomes a wonderland
There are many girls I have met before
But I pass them by because I knew
There would be this magic moment,
One to last a lifetime through
When a boy like me meets a girl like you
When a boy like me meets a girl like you
For the millionth and the last time
Darling let me hold you tight
One more kiss and then I promise
I will say my last goodnight
Though your lips are so inviting
And I know I'll wanna stay
Give me one more kiss to dream on
And I'll be on my way
It seems a million or so kisses ago 
We said goodnight at your door
I didn't get far 'cause here we are
And I'm still begging for more
Whilst the millionth and the last time
Slowly disappears from sight
For the millionth and the last time
Let me kiss you good-night
It seems a million or so kisses ago 
We said goodnight at your door
I didn't get far 'cause here we are
And I'm still begging for more
Whilst the millionth and the last time
Slowly disappears from sight
For the millionth and the last time
Let me kiss you good-night
Let me kiss you good-night
Let me kiss you good-night
There's no joy in my heart only sorrow
And I'm sad as a man can be
I sit alone in the darkness of my lonely room
And this room is a prison to me
I look at my window and what do I see
  (I want to be free, I want to be free)
I see a bird way up in a tree
  (I want to be free, I want to be free)
I want to be free, free, free
  (Oh yes, oh yes)
I want to be free like the bird in the tree
(Want to be free)
Oh, what good are my eyes, they can't see you
And my arms they can't hold you so tight
I have two lips that are yearning but they're no good to me
'Cause I know I can't kiss you tonight
I look at my window and what do I see
  (I want to be free, I want to be free)
I see a bird way up in a tree
  (I want to be free, I want to be free)
I want to be free, free, free
  (Oh yes, oh yes)
I want to be free like a bird in a tree
(Want to be free)
I want to be free like a bird in a tree
(Want to be free)
(words & music hazel shade)
Show me thy ways, o lord

Help me love when I'm hated
Spread joy unabated

Jesus was more than just a man from galilee
Christ the son of god, he died for you and me
They scorched him and walked him upon in delight (? )
Still jesus loved them, forgave and he cried

Help me love when I'm hated

Show me thy ways, o lord

Well, lawdy, lawdy, lawdy Miss Clawdy
Well, you sure look good to me
Well, please don't excite me, baby
I know it can't be me
Well, I give you all my money
Yeah but you just won't treat me right
You like to ball every morning
Don't come home 'til late at night
I'm gonna tell, tell my mama
Lord I swear, gal what you been doing to me
I'm gonna tell everybody that
I'm in misery
So bye, bye, bye, baby
Gal, I won't be comin' no more
Goodbye little darlin'
Down the road I go
Oh goodbye, bye, bye, baby
Gal, I won't be comin' no more
Goodbye little darlin'
Down the road I go
Her hair is soft and her eyes are also blue
She's all the things a girl should be
But she's not you
She knows just how to make me laugh when I feel blue
She's ev'rything a man could want
But she's not you
And when we're dancing, it almost feels the same
I've got to stop myself from whisp'ring your name
She even kisses me like you used to do
And it's just breaking my heart
'Cause she's not you
And it's just breaking my heart
'Cause she's not you
And when we're dancing, it almost feels the same
I've got to stop myself from whisp'ring your name
She even kisses me like you used to do
And it's just breaking my heart
'Cause she's not you
And it's just breaking my heart
'Cause she's not you
I may not be here tomorrow
But I'm close beside you today
So lie to me a little, say you love me a lot
And I'll be true to you in my way
Love never goes on forever
At least that's what wise men all say
So smile when you kiss me, tomorrow you may cry
But I'll be true to you in my way
Yes, I'll be true to you in my way
There's no place like home
Well I say now home, home sweet home
There's no place like home
Wherever you wander
There's no place like home
Well I used to have a sweetheart
To walk and talk with me
But now I have no sweetheart
What pleasure do I see
There's no place like home
Well I say now home, home sweet home
There's no place like home
Wherever you wander
There's no place like home

Blue is not the word for the way that I feel
And the storm brewing in this heart of mine
This is not pleasure, dream I know that it's real
Your someone else's love now, your not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
But my yearning heart keeps saying your not mine
My troubled mind, so soon to another you will be with
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
Please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
But my yearning heart keeps saying your not mine
My troubled mind, so soon to another you will be with
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
Well, since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
It's down at the end of lonely street
At heartbreak hotel
You make me so lonely, baby
I get so lonely, I get so lonely, I could die
And although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
Where broken hearted lovers
Do cry away their gloom
You make me so lonely, baby
I get so lonely, I get so lonely, I could die
Well, the bell hop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well, they been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back
You make me so lonely, baby
I get so lonely, I get so lonely, I could die
Hey now, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street
To heartbreak hotel
Suppose no rose would ever grow again
Suppose no brook would ever flow again
Suppose no star should ever glow again
Suppose you didn't love me
Suppose there were no bees or butterflies
Suppose no bird should ever cross the skies
Suppose the sun should never never rise
Suppose you didn't love me
It's impossible to imagine a world without a star
But imagining no you is more impossible, by far
Suppose the Springtime never should arrive
Suppose the tall green trees should not survive
Suppose I had no wish to be alive 
Suppose you didn't love me
It's impossible to imagine a world without a star
But imagining no you is more impossible, by far
Suppose the Springtime never should arrive
Suppose the tall green trees should not survive
Suppose I had no wish to be alive 
Suppose you didn't love me
Suppose you didn't love me
Oh well, I, John, he saw might numbers
A way up in the middle of the air
I, John he saw might numbers
Way in the middle of the air
Got to mighty move, John, you saw mighty numbers
Way up in the middle of the air
Well there were three gates in the east
And there were three gates in the west
Three gates in the north
Three gates in the south
And that makes twelve gates to the city all square wide
John, you saw might numbers way up in the middle of the air
Well John declared that he saw a man
He held twelve bright stars in his right hand
Well his eyes flashed fire like the burning sun
Old John got scared and he wanted to run
Well he wanted to run but his feet wouldn't go
Cause he felt the gospel cutting like a two-edged sword
And he heard a voice that said John, you take a look
And read what you see and then you write it in a book
And he saw twelve angels in the east
And there were twelve angels in the west
Twelve angels in the north,
Twelve angels in the south
That's a total of forty-eight angels to the city, four squared wide
I hope I never ever love anyone this much again
I can't take it anymore
I've been hurt before
Never ever quite like this time
What will become of me when you're no longer here?
If I can't stop loving you
What am I to do?
You'll be free but where will I be?
Now that I'm used to love, how can I stand alone?
Now that love has come and gone
Like the ending of a song
A song my lonely heart keeps singing
Where do I go from here? Will I get over you?
If so, next time I'll be smart
I'll know before I start
A heart that don't care, don't get broken
I hope I never ever love anyone this much again
Never ever, never again, never again
The girl I never loved
Will never know I cared
And all my dreams of her
Are dreams I'll never share
For I want her and I need her
And I know it might have been
But it ended long before it could begin
The kiss I never got
Somebody else will take
The plans I never made
Somebody else will make
Oh I'm lonely, I'm so lonely
'Cause it's her I'm thinking of
But she'll always be the girl I never loved
Never loved, never loved
Listen, little lady
You're steppin' out of line
What's your hurry baby?
You got a lot of time
Well, that's not love you feel
It's only make believe
Watch out, you'll break the heart
You're wearing on your sleeve
Cheating with your kisses
You think you know it all
Old worry gonna get you
You're riding for a fall
Better slow it down
I see a danger sign
'Cause the way you're steppin' around
You're steppin' out of line
You're cheating with your kisses
You think you know it all
Old worry gonna get you
You're riding for a fall
Better slow it down
I see a danger sign
'Cause the way you're steppin' around
You're steppin' out of line
You're steppin' out of line
You're steppin' out of line
You're steppin' out of line
You're steppin' out of line
You're steppin' out of line

I said I'd hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
Like you've never been held before 
Well I'll think of you each day and then I'll dream the night away
Oh, 'till you are in my arms once more
The stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why
I feel so blue 'cause I'm away from you
Yeah I'll hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
Oh darling please wait for me
You know the stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why

Oh darling please wait for me
Oh well, I'm tired and so weary but I must go alone
Till the Lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning's so bright and the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me
Well the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow and no trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me
Why must I love a heartless woman
Who'll never know the harm she's done?
Though love is blind I should have known
Just call me lonesome from now on
I climb the stairs up to my room
But no one meets me in my gloom
The silence tells me she is gone
Just call me lonesome from now on
These walls will hide me when I cry
Let hope that Heaven lets me die
What good is life when hope is gone
Just call me lonesome from now on
Just call me lonesome from now on
Oh the neons are a gleamin' and the gamblers are a dreamin'
Oh it's night life, yeh! night life
The chips are a spillin' and it's time to make a killin'
Oh it's night life, yeh! night life
Oh the pockets are a-burnin' and the money flies
With dice roll a-turnin' and you'll hit snakes eyes
You can't be a quitter when you're caught up in the glitter of 
Night life night life
There're long legged women who will take you for a trimmin' yes it's night life
Oh night life.
Their lips taste like honey but they're out to spend your money
Yes it's night life. Oh yeh!
Just roll that seven and you'll hear them shriek
When seven come eleven it's a lucky streak
You can't beat the drama, the excitement and the glamour
Of the night life, I said that night life
So place your bet, come on make your play
Though you may regret it at the break of day
I said you can't be a quitter when you're caught up in the glitter of 
Night life night life
Yeh! that night life, good ol' night life
Night life, yes, yes, night life, oh night life 
A rose grows wild in the country
A tree grows tall as the sky
The wind blows wild in the country
And part of the wild, wild country, am I
Wild, wild, like the deer and the dove
Wild and free is this land that I love
A dream grows wild in the country
A love grows tall as the sky
A heart beats wild in the country
And here with a dream in my heart
Part of the wild, wild country, am I
Part of the wild, wild country, am I
A little less conversation, a little more action please

A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby 
Baby close your eyes and listen to the music
Drifting through a summer breeze

A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,

Pulling on the reins.

Some folks tell you what to do
They think they know more than you
They insist that they're givin' sound advice
But as sure as you're livin'
It ain't sound, it ain't nice
It just doesn't sound like sound advice
Some folks like to be the boss
They get up on their high horse
Oh they say that you're gettin, sound advice
There one thing I'm bettin'
It ain't wise, it ain't nice
You won't like the sound of their advice
Sound advice we're given
Just as sure as your as you're livin'
If your smart you'll think twice
When they start to sound off with advice
Sound advice we're given
Just as sure as your as you're livin'
If your smart you'll think twice
When they start to sound off with advice
Don't listen to their sound advice
I got a dirty, dirty feeling
Dirty feeling's goin' on
You know I almost hit the ceilin'
When I woke up and you were gone
I took you in when you were hungry
And now you're cuttin' out on me
I'm gonna help you little darlin'
That ain't the way it's gonna be
I hear you're pretty good at runnin'
But pretty soon you'll slip and fall
That's when I'll drag you home with me, girl
I'm gonna chain you to the wall
You know I'm lookin' for you baby
I ain't gonna take it layin' down
I heard that you were cookin' baby
Way on the other side of town
I got a dirty, dirty feeling
Dirty feeling's goin' on
You know I almost hit the ceilin'
When I woke up and you were gone
Bright light city gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waitin' out there
And they're all livin' devil may care
And I'm just the devil with love to spare
Viva Las Vegas, viva Las Vegas
How I wish that there were more
Than the twenty-four hours in the day
'Cause even if there were forty more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's black jack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas, viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashin'
And your one arm bandits crashin'
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas turnin' day into nighttime
Turnin' night into daytime
If you see it once you'll never be the same again
I'm gonna keep on the run, I'm gonna have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke up well
I'll always remember that I had a swingin' time
I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas, viva Las Vegas, viva Las Vegas
Viva, viva Las Vegas
I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven fill my soul
He bathed my heart in love and He wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus makes me whole
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry, He will answer by and by
And when you feel a little prayer wheel turnin'
And you will know a little fire is burnin'
Find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
I may have doubts and fears, my eye be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to him in prayer, He knows my every care
And just a little talk with my Jesus makes it right
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry, He will answer by and by
And when you feel a little prayer wheel turnin'
And you will know a little fire is burnin'
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry and He will answer by and by
And when you feel a little prayer wheel turnin'
And you will know a little fire is burnin'
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Right, right, right
I had to leave town for a little while
You said, you'd be good while I'm gone
But the look in your eye dun told me you told a lie
I know there's been some carryin' on
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
The ash trays are all full of ashes
The floor needs a touch of the mop
There's a man downstairs with a long bushy hair
He said your party was a three day rock
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Baby, if you ever loved me
Then Bonnie and Clyde loved the law
Well, a bird can't fly and I don't like apple pie
And trees won't grow in Arkansas
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
I had to leave town for a little while
You said, you'd be good while I'm gone
But the look in your eye dun told me you told a lie
I know there's been some carryin' on
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, you're wearin' that loved on look
Shoop, shoop
Without Him I could do nothing
Without Him I'd surely fail
Without Him I would be drifting
Like a ship without a sail
Without Him I would be dying
Without Him I'd be enslaved
Without Him life would be worthless
But with Jesus thank God I'm saved
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Do you know Him today
Please don't turn Him away
Oh Jesus, my Jesus
Without Him how lost I would be
Without Him how lost I would be
I was always, baby, I was always
Well almost always true to you
Met a pretty mademoiselle
Her papa owned a small hotel
Oh, I was almost always true to you
I resisted though my arm was twisted
I was almost always true to you
I stayed away from drinkin' wine
Thought about you all the time
Oh, I was almost always true to you
Kept refusin' don't jump to conclusions
I was almost always true to you
I would never grab like this
I would never steal a kiss
Oh, I was almost always true to you
I was almost always true to you
Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write
I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart
I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And darlin', then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart
Oh yes, I know it's true
The more you fall in love
The more your heart can break in two
Now that you've said goodbye
For every tender kiss
I've had the tears I cry
I gave my heart and soul
All the love I knew
Oh how much it hurts me now
To know that we are through
I'll always feel this way
My arms will be so empty
You'll return some day and say
Your love, yes your big love
Will be here to stay
Till then it's
Your love yes your big love
Will be here to stay
Wherever you go
Wherever you may wander in your life
Well surely you know, surely
I always wanna be there
Holding your hand
And standing by to catch you, when you fall
Seeing you through, in everything you do
I said, let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
(Let it make it right)
Let me take you to that wonderland, that only two can share
All I ask you, let me be there
(Let me be there)
Watching you grow
And going through the changes in your life
Well, that's how I know
(That's how I know)
I always wanna to be there
Whenever you feel, you need a friend to lean on
Here I am
Whenever you call, you know I'll be there
I said, let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
(Let it make it right)
Let me take you to that wonderland, that only two can share
All I ask you, let me be there
Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
(Let it make it right)
Let me take you to that wonderland, that only two can share
All I ask you, is let me be there

Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well that long black train got my baby and gone
Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Well it took my baby, but it never will again
No, not again
Train train, comin' down, down the line
Train train, comin' down, down the line
Well it's bringin' my baby, 'cause she's mine all, all mine
She's mine, all, all mine
Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Well it took my baby, but it never will again
Never will again
(Ooh, woah)
Wise men say only fools rush in
but I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay
would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
some things are meant to be
take my hand, take my whole life too
for I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
some things are meant to be
take my hand, take my whole life too
for I can't help falling in love with you
for I can't help falling in love with you
But now after loving you, what else is there to do
For honey, all the rest is just gonna have to be second best
I know I'll go through life comparing her to you
That's 'cause I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone after loving you
Your precious love cannot be erased by just another woman with a pretty face
And your memory, you know it will remain for it cannot be erased
Other loves may come along, they can't live up to you
That's 'cause I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone after loving you
Your precious love cannot be erased by just another woman with a pretty face
And your memory, you know it will remain for it cannot be erased
Other loves may come along, they can't live up to you
That's 'cause I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone after loving you
I said I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone after loving you
I said I'm no good, I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone
To anyone, to anyone, to anyone after loving you
That's 'cause I'm no good, I'm no good to anyone after loving you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
And if you say good-bye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna love you more and more every day
I'm gonna love you more and more in every way
And if you say good-bye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna tell my mama tell my papa too
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna do
And if you say good-bye
Say if you ever even try
Relax, kick your shoes off baby
Relax, here we are alone
Relax, if the phone rings, let it
Just forget it, we're not at home
Cut loose, let your hair down honey
Unwind, turn the lights down low
Relax, let's uncork the stopper
Come to papa, come on let's go
Defrost, your charms
There's only the two of us here
Come in my arms
And make yourself comfortable dear
Relax, let's get cozy baby
Come on, let your concrete crack
Cut loose, when the knock's invited
Don't you fight it, come on relax
Defrost, your charms
There's only the two of us here
Come in my arms
And make yourself comfortable dear
Relax, let's get cozy baby
Come on, let your concrete crack
Cut loose, life is worth the livin'
When you're givin', come on relax
Relax.....mmmmm....let loose...mmmm...defrost....mmmmm...
Come along, come along, there's a full moon shining bright
Come along, come along, we're gonna hit St. Louis tonight
Spend your money looking at the chorus line
Spend your money, win it on the number 9
Take your sweetheart even though she's never been
If she's worried tell her that you always win
Come along, come along, there's a full moon shining bright
Come along, come along, you're gonna win a fortune tonight
Hear the whistle, lady luck's about to go
Is she smiling, maybe yes or maybe no
Now's the time when nights are filled with sweet romance
Don't be bashful step on up and take a chance
Come along, come along, there's a full moon shining bright
Come along, come along, we're gonna hit St. Louis tonight
Come along, come along, we're gonna win a fortune tonight
Hear that lonesome winter bird
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves began to die
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry
All right
Well, I'll be back, yeah, I'll be back
Like a homesick train on a one-way track
I got to travel and hit the gravel
But I'll be back, yeah, I'll be back
Well, I'll return, I shall return
Don't cool those lips, we're gonna see 'em burn
'Cause I'll be missin' your kinda kissin'
But I'll be back, yeah, I'll be back
Yeah, there ain't nobody to tell me stay or go, oh no
And no one tells the four winds where to blow
I'll be back, I'm comin' back
Don't throw away that welcome mat
The door I'm hopin', will still be open a teeny weenie crack
To your shack
So keep that love light burnin'
But I'll be back, yeah, I'll be back
Yeah, there ain't nobody to tell me stay or go, oh no
And no one tells the four winds where to blow
I'll be back, I'm comin' back
Don't throw away that welcome mat
The door I'm hopin' will still be open a teeny weenie crack
To your shack
So keep that love light burnin', I'll be back
Yeah, I'll be back
Before you go, walk out on me
Take a look around, tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here, you might have overlooked
'Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be
The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself a-while
It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago
I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin' us apart
And you could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart
So one more time, for ol' times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away
We can forget the bad and take the best
If you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake
And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake
Yesterday, I slipped away
The sun is welcoming the evening shadows
On a perfect day and the next step is love
The next step is love
We walked barefoot through the misty meadows
Laughing at each other in the rain
Made some faces at some people in the park
Didn't bother to explain
Fun, fun, look at us run
Going nowhere special really fast
But we've yet to taste the icing on the cake
That we've been baking with the past
And the next step is love
So what are we waiting for?
The next step is love
Girl, it's for sure
Love will be a place to run to
From the world they've built to you and me
We'll be closer than we've ever been
Though looking back it's so hard to believe
Hang it all out or bring it all in
The best we've picked upon the way tonight
Changes are coming but together
We can make it through somehow
Yes the next step is love
On the hills of Georgia
Across the plains of Tennessee
I've seen and I've done most everything
That a man can do or see
But if I could only borrow one dream from yesterday
I'd be on that train tomorrow
I'll be home on Christmas day
And so many times before
She left that candle burning
Oh, too many tears fell
My soul fills with yearning
If I had sense at all
I'd just be on my way
Be on that train tomorrow
Be home on Christmas day
Everytime I think about her
All the love I left behind
Memories still linger in my troubled mind
I could set aside my pride
And I'd be on my way
I'd catch that train tomorrow
And be home on Christmas day
If I had any sense at all
I'd just be on my way
I'd catch that train tomorrow
I'd be home on Christmas day
I said I'd catch that train tomorrow
I'd be home on Christmas day
As I read the letters, oh that you wrote to me
Well it's you, it's you I'm thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darlin', more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love
As I think of the past, all the pleasures that we had
As I watch the mating of the doves
It was in the spring time that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love
Yeah, I miss you darlin', more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think, think of you
And remember our faded love
I remember our faded love
I remember our faded love
Well, I miss you darlin', more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think, think of you
And remember our faded love
Yes I remember our faded love
I remember our faded love
God bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you
Let it be me
Don't take this Heaven from one
Well if you must cling to someone
Now and forever
Let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
Tell me, what would life be?
So never leave me lonely
Just tell me you love me only
And that you'll always
Let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Oh without your sweet love
Tell me, what would life be?
So never leave me lonely
And just tell me you love me only
And that you'll always
Let it be me
And that you'll always
Let it be me
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always
Let it be me
Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems there's a longing for you still
Oh, but I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill
Oh, someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
Well, to listen to the rain to beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill, well, oh
Oh, someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
But to listen to the rain to beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill
Oh, someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
To listen to the rain beat on my window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill
In our little cabin home on the hill

I hear the bells
Saying christmas is near
They ring out to tell the world
That this is the season of cheer
I hear a choir
Singing sweetly somewhere
And a glow fills my heart
I'm at peace with the world
As the sound of their singing fills the air
Oh why can't every day be like christmas
Why can't that feeling go on endlessly
For if everyday could be just like christmas
What a wonderful world this would be
I hear a child
Telling santa what to bring
And the smile upon his tiny face
Is worth more to me than anything
When I think of how He came so far from glory
Came to dwell among the lowly such as I
To suffer shame and such disgrace on Mount Calvary
Take my place then I ask myself this question, "Who am I?"
Who am I that the King would bleed and die for?
Who am I that He would pray not my will, Thy Lord?
The answer I may never know, why He ever loved me so
But to an old rugged cross He'd go for who am I?
When I'm reminded of His words, I'll leave Him never
If you'll be true I'll give to you life forever
Oh, I wonder what I could have done to deserve God's only Son
To fight my battles until they're won for who am I?
Who am I that the King would bleed and die for?
Who am I that He would pray not my will, Thy Lord?
The answer I may never know, why He ever loved me so
But to an old rugged cross He'd go for who am I?
But to an old rugged cross He'd go for who am I?
You look like an angel
Walk like an angel
Talk like an angel
But I got wise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh yes you are
The devil in disguise
You fooled me with your kisses
You cheated and you schemed
Heaven knows how you lied to me
You're not the way you seemed
You look like an angel
Walk like an angel
Talk like an angel
But I got wise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh yes you are
The devil in disguise
I thought that I was in heaven
But I was sure surprised
Heaven help me, I didn't see
The devil in your eyes
You look like an angel
Walk like an angel
Talk like an angel
But I got wise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh yes you are
The devil in disguise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh yes you are
The devil in disguise
Oh yes you are
The devil in disguise
The words of her promise
The flame of her faith
The love that would never drift away
Where did they go Lord, where did they go?
You know somehow forever 
Slipped out of my hands
And my dreams ran away with the wind
Where did they go Lord, where did they go
You know sometimes I wish
I had lost her to another
Well but Lord she just walked off all alone
And the heart that's within me is not bitter just hurt
And bewildered because her love had gone
Oh the passion I trusted
The truth that I leaned on
And the hope that would forever keep me strong
I cry out my questions
Oh, the answers are all gone
Where did they go Lord, tell me where did they go
Where did they go Lord, tell me where did they go
Any day now I will hear you say
Goodbye my love
You'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now
(Any day now)
I'll be all alone
(I'll be all alone)
Any day now, when your restless eyes
Meet someone new, to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
Any day now
(Any day now)
Love will let me down
(Love will let me down)
I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay, yeah
Until you've gone forever
I'll be holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now when the clock strikes go
You'll call it off, then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
Any day now
(Any day now, any day now)
Love will let me down
(Love will let me down)
And you won't be around
(Any day now)
Any day now, any day now
Don't fly away, my beautiful bird
(Any day now)
Don't fly away, my beautiful bird
(Any day now)
Any day now, don't fly away
I believe for every drop of rain falls
A flower grow
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come
To show the way
I believe, I believe
I believe above storm smallest prayer
Can still be heard
I believe someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word
Every time, I hear new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why
I believe
Every time, I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why
I believe
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, baby
If you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, baby
It will never do anyhow
When your rooster's a crowing at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason why I'm traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right
An' it ain't no use in turning on your light, baby
The light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turning on your light, baby
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was something I could do or say
To try and make you change your mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you anymore
I'm a thinking and a wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
So long, honey, baby
Where I'm bound, I cannot tell
But goodbye's too good a word, gal
So I'll just kinda say, "Fare thee well"
Now I'm not saying that you treated me unkind
You could have done a lot better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right
I'm falling in love, tonight
Somehow, I know
The beautiful world tonight
Is sharing, it's glow
When love let me down before
I said I was through
But I'm falling in love tonight
With you
'till you walked by
I laughed and played the game
One last kiss, then goodbye
And out went the flame
But somehow, you've changed me dear
This time, it's true
I'm falling in love tonight
With you
I'm beginning to forget you
That old heartache is gone
I'm beginning to sleep at night
No more crying 'till dawn
I can hear your name mentioned
And it brings no misery
I'm beginning to forget you
Like you forgot me
I'm beginning to smile again
After crying for so long
I can hear the tune we loved so well
And it's just another song
I'm so happy that it's over
I'm so thankful to be free
I'm beginning to forget you
Like you forgot me
As the snow flies 
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin' 
A poor little baby child is born 
In the ghetto 
And his mama cries 
'cause if there's one thing that she don't need 
it's another hungry mouth to feed 
In the ghetto 
People, don't you understand 
the child needs a helping hand 
or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day 
Take a look at you and me, 
are we too blind to see, 
do we simply turn our heads 
and look the other way 
Well the world turns 
and a hungry little boy with a runny nose 
plays in the street as the cold wind blows 
In the ghetto 
And his hunger burns 
so he starts to roam the streets at night 
and he learns how to steal 
and he learns how to fight 
In the ghetto 
Then one night in desperation 
a young man breaks away 
He buys a gun, steals a car, 
tries to run, but he don't get far 
And his mama cries 
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man 
face down on the street with a gun in his hand 
In the ghetto 
As her young man dies, 
on a cold and gray Chicago mornin', 
another little baby child is born 
In the ghetto
I could ride around the world in an old oxcart
And never let another girl thrill my heart
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you so?
I could meet a hundred girls and have loads of fun
My huggin' and my kissin' belong to just one
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you so?
If you gave me nine lives like a tommy cat
I'd give 'em all to you and never take one back
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you so?
I'm putting on my Sunday suit and I'm goin' downtown
But I'll be kissin' your lips before the sun goes down
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you so?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you so?
I was the one who taught her to kiss
The way that she kisses you now
And you know the way she touches your cheek
Well, I taught her how
I was the one who taught her to cry
When she wants you under her spell
The sight of her tears drives you out of your mind
I taught her so well
And then one day
I had my love as perfect as could be
She lived, she loved, she laughed, she cried
And it was all for me
I'll never know who taught her to lie
Now that it's over and done
Who learned the lesson when she broke my heart?
I was the one
And then one day
I had my love as perfect as could be
She lived, she loved, she laughed, she cried
And it was all for me
I'll never know who taught her to lie
Now that it's over and done
Who learned the lesson when she broke my heart?
I was the one
"When I was a child, ladies and gentleman, I was a dreamer.I read comic books, 
and I was a hero in the movie.So every dream that I ever dreamed has come true 
a hundred times.I learned very early in life that without a song, the day would 
never end; without a song, a man ain't got a friend; without a song, the road 
would never bend; without a song.So I keep singing a song.Goodnight, Thank 
You".
When no one else can understand me
When everything I do is wrong
You give me hope and consolation
You give me strength to carry on
And you're always there
To lend a hand in everything I do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you
(Wonder of you)
And when you smile the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king
Your kiss to me is worth a fortune
Your love for me is everything
I guess, I'll never know
The reason why you love me like you do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you
I guess, I'll never know
The reason why you love me as you do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you
Little darlin', little darlin'
Oh where, are you
Walla walla chipa mocka mogga
Oh my lover, oh just for you, only you
My darlin', I need you
Darlin' I need you to call my own
To hold on my life, your little foot, your hand
Knew someone would understand that, hold my hand
My dear, I would run to find without you
Oh, That my love was just for you, 'n only you
What now my love, now that you left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And all my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I'm numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night, oh, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul
What now my love, now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here comes the stars tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be
What now my love, now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live or die
What now my love, now there is nothing
Only my last goodbye
Only my last goodbye
Well, He's so high (so high you can't get over Him)
So wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
So low (so low you can't get under him)
Great God Almighty (you must come in at the door)
Oh well, He's high (so high you can't get over Him)
He's wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
So low (so low you can't get under him)
The mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)
Well I went down in the valley
You know I did over there ever stay
My soul got happy in the valley
You know I stayed right there all day
Well, He's high (so high you can't get over Him)
And he's wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
I know he's so low (so low you can't get under him)
The mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)
Well I ain't been to heaven but I'm, I'm told
The streets the streets are pearls
You know the mighty mighty
Mighty gates are gold
And He's high (so high you can't get over Him)
So wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
He's so low (so low you can't get under him)
The mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)
Well, He's high (so high you can't get over Him)
And he's wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
I know he's so low (so low you can't get under him)
The mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)
Lying by your side I watch you sleeping
And in your face the sweetness of a child
Murmuring the dream you won't recapture
Though it will haunt the corners of your mind
Oh, I've lost you though you're near me,
And you're body's still as kind
I've lost you on the journey
But I can't remamber where or when.
Who can tell when summer turns to autumn
And who can point the moment love grows cold
Softly without pain the joy is over
Though why it's gone neither of us know
Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore 
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh
Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore 
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling
Six o'clock the baby will be crying
And you will stumble, sleepy, to the door
In the chill and sun gray of the morning
We play the parts that we have learned to well
Oh, I've lost you, oh, I've lost you
Though you want a minute so
I've lost you on the journey
But I can't remamber where or when, oh no
Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore 
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling

You're a heartbreaker,
You're a love faker,
A heartbreaker playing with fire.
You're a tear snatcher,
You're a quarrel patcher,
But you can't break my heart anymore,
For I just found someone else who's sure to take your place.
Someone I can always trust and to fill this empty space.
You're a heartbreaker,
You're a love faker,
But you can't break my heart anymore.
You're a smooth talker,
You're a real cool walker,
But now you have talked out of turn.
You're a high stepper,
You're a eye-catcher,
But you won't catch my glances anymore.
For I just found someone else who's sure to take your place,
Someone I can always trust and to fill this empty space.
You're a heartbreaker
You're a love faker,
But you can't break my heart anymore.
You're a heart breaker
You're a love faker,
A heartbreaker playing with fire.
You're a tear snatcher,
You're a quarrel patcher,
But you can't break my heart anymore.
For I've just found someone else who's sure to take your place.
Someone I can always trust and to fill this empty space.
You're a heartbreaker,

But you can't break my heart anymore.
Holy smoke
land sakes alive!
I never thought this could happen to me
Mm, yeah! Mm, yeah!
I got stung by a sweet honey bee
Oh, what a feeling come over me
It started in my eyes
Crept up to my head
Flew to my heart
Till I was stung dead
I'm done, uh-uh
I got stung!
Mm, yeah! Mm, yeah!
She had all that I wanted and more
And I've seen honey bees before
Started buzzin' in my ear
Buzzin' in my brain
Got stung all over
But I feel no pain
I'm done, uh-uh
I got stung!
Now, don't think I'm complainin'
I'm mighty pleased we met
'Cause you gimme just one little peck
On the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold cold sweat
If I live to a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzin' 'round your hive
Ev'ry day at five
And I'm never gonna leave once I arrive
'Cause I'm done
Uh-uh, I got stung!
Now, don't think I'm complainin'
I'm mighty pleased we met
'Cause you gimme just one little peck
On the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold cold sweat
If I live to a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzin' 'round your hive
Ev'ry day at five
And I'm never gonna leave once I arrive
'Cause I'm done
Uh-uh, I got stung
At night
When the sky is still
When the south wind blows
And the air is warm
There's a world that's born
And for every child on the beach that day
Stands a castle tall and proud
And the warm wind crawls through the castle walls
And the nightfolk wake as the warm wind calls
At night
When the sky is still
When the south wind blows
And the air is warm
There's a world that's born
Then the fiddler crab plays his violin
On the back of a dancing whale
While the mermaid sing to the shell they bring
And the dragon leads with his sweeping tail
At night
When the sky is still
When the south wind blows
And the air is warm
There's a world that's born
For the rosy dawn
Brings the children on to the beach that's bright and new
And the nightfolk know as the castles grow
They will play once more as the children do
At night
When the sky is still
When the south wind blows
And the air is warm
There's a world that's born
Amen,Amen,Amen,Amen,Amen sing it with us everybody. Amen,Amen,Amen,Amen,Amen,right half a staff. Amen,Amen,Amen,Amen,Amen,take it up one more half now. Amen,Amen,Amen,Amen,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmen.
I gave my heart
I gave my love
Oh ho, my darling
I am true
Doin' the best 
The best I can
But it's not good enough for you
I tried so hard
So hard to please
Oh ho, my darling
What more can I do
Doin' the best 
The best I can
But it's not good enough for you
You know I was the kind who'd run
Any time you'd call
I guess I was the only one
Who didn't mind at all
I'll be a dreamer
I'll be a fool
Oh ho, my darling
My whole life through
Doin' the best 
The best I can
But it's not good enough for you
You know I was the kind who'd run
Any time you'd call
I guess I was the only one
Who didn't mind at all
I'll be a dreamer
I'll be a fool
Oh ho, my darling
My whole life through
Doin' the best 
The best I can
But it's not good enough for you
But it's not good enough for you
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Good
Who never learned to read or write at all
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell
Go, go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny, go go
Go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go go
Johnny B. Good
His mama told him "someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear your playing music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday you will be in lights saying Johnny B. Good"
Hmmm.....
And all the world go free
Now there's a cross for everyone
And there's a cross for me
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
(where are the words) wonder proclaim
And the paint upon the wall
Will go straight ??
In the light of his wonderful face

Come on everybody and snap your fingers now
Come on everybody clap your hands real loud
Come on everybody take a real deep breath
And repeat after me
Lovin' my baby
Lovin' my baby
Hey, hey, hey and my baby loves me
Come on everybody and whistle this tune right now
Come on everybody and stomp your feet real loud
Come on everybody take a real deep breath
And repeat after me
Lovin' my baby
Lovin' my baby
Hey, hey, hey and my baby loves me
Well there ain't nothing wrong with the long-haired music
Like Brahms, Beethoven and Bach
Well I was raised with a guitar in my hand
And I was born to rock
Well, come on everybody and turn your head to the left
Come on everybody and turn your head to the right
Come on everybody take a real deep breath
And repeat after me
Lovin' my baby
Lovin' my baby
Hey, hey, hey and my baby loves me
Just like an old grandfather's clock that won't stop running
Like an old racehorse that just wont ever quit
There'll be no end to loving you
Nothing can stop me once I start
'Cos I'm a one track mind and a one track heart
Well I'm as stubborn as a mule I just won't let up
Like an old bloodhound Ill hang around your trail
There'll be no end to loving you
Don't try to stop me if you're smart
'Cos I'm a one track mind and a one track heart
Oooo- eeeee there'll be no turning back
Oooo- eeeee I'm gonna stay on your track
Just like a choo-choo train that's gotta keep a-chugging
You'll find that I'm the kind who sticks to what I do
There'll be no end to loving you, baby we'll never be apart
'Cos I'm a one track mind and a one track heart
Oooo- eeeee there'll be no turning back
Oooo- eeeee I'm gonna stay on your track
Just like a choo-choo train that's gotta keep a-chugging
You'll find that I'm the kind who sticks to what I do
There'll be no end to loving you, baby we'll never be apart
'Cos I'm a one track mind and a one track heart
Cowboy, cowboy marry me
I'll bake you a cherry pie
Well thank you very kindly mam
But I'm too young to die
Hi-lo-do-si-dosy-do
Stay single and save a dollar

With a cane and a high starched collar
Cowboy if you'll marry me

Now why should I drink from just one well
When I can drink from twen'y
Hi-lo-do-si-dosy-do

Hi-lo-do-si-dosy-do
Stay single and save a dollar
Come Saturday night I'll court a pretty girl
With a cane and a high starched collar

Evening shadows make me blue
When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you
My happiness
Every day I reminesce 
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss
My happiness
A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then
Whether skies are grey or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you
My happiness
A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then
Whether skies are grey or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you
My happiness
I don't need a lot of presents
To make my Christmas bright
I just need my baby's arms
Wound around me tight
Oh oh santa hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
The Christmas tree is ready
The candles all aglow
But with my baby far away
What good is mistletoe
Oh oh Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
Please make these reindeer hurry
Well their time is drawing near
It sure won't seem like Christmas
Until my baby's here
Fill my sock with candy
And a bright and shiny toy
You wanna make me happy and fill my heart with joy
Then Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
Please make these reindeer hurry
Well their time is drawing near
It sure won't seem like Christmas
Until my baby's here
Fill my sock with candy
And a bright and shiny toy
You wanna make me happy and fill my heart with joy
Then Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
Then Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
Six-foot-six, stood on the ground
Weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love
He was the kind of man to gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup
Because of love
Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
Like the world it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up, it can put you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time, nothing's ever been found
Stronger than love
Some men are like me, they worry and doubt
Trouble their minds, day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about
A thing called love
But then I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I think by God, this world was blessed
With a thing called love
Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
Like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up, it can put you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time, nothing's ever been found
Stronger than love
Take a ton of bolt and steel
A whole lotta sweat, a set of wheels
On the Speedway
The flag is down, pistons pound
Plenty of engines ripping around .. on the Speedway
Go for the money and lead the pack
Push the throttle and burn the track
Curl and swirl like you doin' a dance
Speedway's comin' and now's your chance
On the Speedway, on the Speedway, on the Speedway
Stoke that pedal down to the floor
As much as you give, crowd wants more
More, more, more, more, more on the Speedway
On the Speedway
Take a spin, hit the brakes
A young little girl .. shivers and shakes
On the Speedway
Clear the way, comin' through
Kiss from your baby just pushin' you
On the Speedway
Go for the money and lead the pack
Push the throttle and burn the track
Curl and swirl like you doin' a dance
Speedway's comin' and now's your chance
On the Speedway, on the Speedway, on the Speedway
Stoke that pedal down to the floor
As much as you give, crowd wants more
More, more, more, more, more on the Speedway
On the Speedway
On the Speedway, on the Speedway, on the Speedway
On the Speedway, on the Speedway, on the Speedway
On the Speedway, on the Speedway
I play the song, it was our own
Your photograph's by my side
I know I can't forget you
So I don't even try
The note you left is in my hand
I read again what you say
You're sorry but you love him
And you've both gone away
This is the story of a man
Whose world has fallen apart
And it's the story
That is breaking my heart
An open fire, our favorite chair
I get a book from the shelf
But the words I am reading
Could apply to myself
This is the story of a man
Whose world has fallen apart
And it's the story
That is breaking my heart
Yes, it's the story that is breaking my heart
Yes, it's the story that is breaking my heart
Yes, it's the story that is breaking my heart
(words & music by s. wayne - b. weisman)
Who are you, who am i? 
Are we more than strangers passing by? 
Is this your dream are you in mine? 
Are we really here or lost in time? 
Will you be friend or lover
Show me the heart you conceal
Now is the time to discover
If this feeling we're feeling is real
So close to love and yet so far
Just one kiss will tell us who we are
Will you be friend or lover
Show me the heart you conceal
Now is the time to discover
If this feeling we're feeling is real
So close to love and yet so far
Just one kiss will tell us who we are
Who made the mountains, who made the trees
Who made the rivers flow to the sea
And who sends the rain when the earth is dry
Somebody bigger than you and I
Who made the flowers to bloom in the spring
Who made the song for the robins to sing
And who hung the moon and the stars in the sky
Somebody bigger than you and I
He lights the way when the road is long
He keeps you company
And with His love to guide you
He walks beside you
Just like He walks with me
When we're filled with despair
Who gives me courage to go from there
And who gives me faith that will never die
Somebody bigger than you and I
Babe, you're getting closer
The lights are goin' dim
The sound of your breathin'
Has made the mood I'm in
All of my resistance
Is lying on the floor
Taking me to places
I've never been before
Ooh, and I can feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Way down where the music plays
Way down like a tidal wave
Way down where the fires blaze
Way down, down, way, way on down
Ooh, my head is spinnin'
You got me in your spell
A hundred magic fingers
On a whirling carousel
The medicine within me
No doctor could prescribe
Your love is doing' something
That I just can't describe
Ooh, and I can feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Way down where the music plays
Way down like a tidal wave
Way down where the fires blaze
Way down, down, way, way on down
Hold me again
Tight as you can
I need you so
Baby, let's go
Way down where it feels so good
Way down where I hoped it would
Way down where I never could
Way down, down, way, way on down

It's a long lonely highway when you're travellin' all alone
And it's a mean old world when you got no-one to call your own
And you pass through towns too small to even have a name, oh yes
But you gotta keep on goin', on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin', though there's no-one to care
Just keep movin' down the line
It's a long lonely highway without her by my side
And it's a trail full of teardrops that keep on being cried
My heart's so heavy it's a low down dirty shame oh yes
You gotta keep on goin', on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin', though there's no-one to care
Just keep movin' down the line
I gotta rock for my pillow 'neath a weeping willow
And the cool grass for my bed
My drinking water's muddy so don't you tell me buddy
That I wouldn't be better off dead
It's a long lonely highway gettin' longer all the time
And if she don't come and get me
Well, I'm gonna lose my mind
So if you read about me tell her she's the one to blame, oh yes
You gotta keep on goin', on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin', though there's no-one to care
Just keep movin' down the line
Movin' down the line
Movin' down the line
Oh, you tell me that you love me
Yes, you tell me that you care
That tomorrow, we'll be married, oh
But tomorrow's never there
Oh tomorrow, never never comes
No, tomorrow never comes
Now you tell me that you love me, oh
But tomorrow never comes
Many weeks now have I waited
Oh many, many long nights have I cried
Oh, just to see that happy morning, happy morning
When I have you right by my side
But tomorrow will never ever come, oh no, no
Tomorrow never gonna come
Now you tell me that you love me, oh
But tomorrow never, never comes
So tomorrow, I'll be leaving
Yes tomorrow, I'll be gone
But tomorrow you'll, you'll be weeping, oh
But tomorrow will never, never come
Well tomorrow, ain't never gonna come, oh no no
Tomorrow ain't never gonna come
Yeah, yeah, you tell me, you tell me you love me
That you love me, but tomorrow never comes
Hot dog, you say you're really coming back
Hot dog, I'm waiting at the railway track
Hot dog, you say you're coming home for good
Hot dog, I'm going to keep on knocking wood
And baby, I can hardly wait
I'm gonna meet you at the gate, hot dog
I fell in love with you and then you, oh, you went away
But now you're coming home to stay
Hot dog, soon everything will be all right
Hot dog, we're gonna have a ball tonight
I've got a pocketful of dimes
It's gonna be just like old times, hot dog
You went away and every day was misery
But now you're coming back to me
Hot dog, my heart is gonna go insane
Hot dog, when you come walking off the train
Oh, how lonely I have been
But when that Santa Fe pulls in, hot dog, baby, hot dog
If I can never see you, if I can never hold you
If I can never touch your face or feel your warm embrace
I still remember talkin', I still remember laughin'
I still remember lovin' a lot, yes touchin' you, babe I've not forgot
And everything's bringin' it back, you're only just bringin' it back
A familiar place for a familiar face just brings it all back
And everything's bringin' it back, good songs bringin' it back
Even after so much time, you know everything's bringin' it back
Thinkin' in my solitude, wonderin' about your attitude
Thinkin' maybe that your love has died, there it is, I can see it in your eyes
And a look of sweet surrender but a touch of too much sadness
'Cause I've hurt you so, you know your sorrow shows
And you just can't stay, oh but you can't let go
'Cause everything's bringin' it back, you're only just bringin' it back
A familiar place for a familiar face just brings it all back
And everything's bringin' it back, good songs bringin' it back
And even after so much time, you know everything's bringin' it back
And everything's bringin' it back, good songs bringin' it back
And even after so much time, you know everything's bringin' it back
And everything's bringin' it back, bringin' it back
There's a ship lies rigged and ready in the harbor
Tomorrow forOld England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales
And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see that foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into Hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
Though death and darkness gather all about me
And my ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should I return safe home again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the Dale
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
Oh you can take a whole lot of sand
And build a castle on the beach
And though you mold it and you plan
Still you got nothing in your reach
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love, that's sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of art
You can build a tower of clay
But if you ask my advice
Well it is worthless as I say
I got no heart it's cold as ice
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love, that's sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of art
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love, that's sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of art
A house of sand is an empty work of art
A house of sand is an empty work of art
If I'm a fool for loving you
Then that's just what I want to be
They're saying I am just your clown
And any fool could see
That you're just having fun
And you're not in love with me
The things they're saying may be true
But there's something they can't see
If I'm a fool for loving you
Then that's just what I want to be
If I'm a dreamer, let me dream
If I'm your clown I'll steal the show
If things are not the way they seem
Please don't ever let me know
If I am blind it's because
I just don't want to see
If I'm a fool for loving you
Then that's just what I want to be
If I'm a dreamer, let me dream
If I'm your clown I'll steal the show
If things are not the way they seem
Please don't ever let me know
If I am blind it's because
I just don't want to see
If I'm a fool for loving you
Then that's just what I want to be
If I'm a fool for loving you
Then that's just what I want to be
If I'm a fool for loving you
Lover doll, oh lover doll 
Lover doll, lover doll 
You're the cutest lover doll
That I ever did ever see
Let me tell you lover doll
You were meant, just meant for me
On the first time that I saw you
How I fell for your cuddly charms
Lover doll I'm crazy for you
Let me rock you in my arms
I'm so glad I found you
Never thought dollies came full grown
I'm gonna tie a ribbon around you
Wrap you up and take you home
I would never treat you badly
Like a cast away broken toy
Lover doll I love you madly
Let me be your lover boy
I'm so glad I found you
Never thought dollies came full grown
I'm gonna tie a ribbon around you
Wrap you up and take you home
I would never treat you badly
Like a cast away broken toy
Lover doll I love you madly
Let me be your lover boy
Lover doll, lover doll 
Lover doll, lover doll
Lover doll, lover doll
Let me be your lover boy
When I was a child, ladies and gentlemen, I was a dreamer. 
I read comic books, and I was the hero of the comic book. I saw movies, and I 
was the hero in the movie.So every dream I ever dreamed has come true a hundred 
times. These gentlemen over there, these are the type who care, are dedicated. 
You realize if it´s not possible that they might be building the kingdom, 
it´s not far-fetched from reality. I´d like to say that I learned 
very early in life that: 
'Without a song the day would never end
Without a song a man ain´t got a friend
Without a song the road would never bend
Without a song...'
So I keep singing a song.
Good night.
Thank you.
Oh Jonah he was desperate in the belly of the whale
Well Jonah had a plan, he knew he couldn't fail
He raised his head on high
And looking for the sky
And he sang his song so pretty
The whale told him goodbye
You got to sing you children sing
Sing you children sing
I only know one thing, hey! hey! hey!
Sing you children sing, everybody
Sing you children sing
Sing your troubles away
Well Moses said good Lord
Open up these waters for me
So I can get your chidren
Across the salty sea
Well the Lord parted the waters
And singing hand in hand
Moses and the children 
Walked over to the promised land
You got to sing you children sing 
Sing you children sing
I only know one thing, hey! hey! hey!
Sing you children sing, everybody
Sing you children sing 
Sing your troubles away
Oh Joshua had a plan
At the walls of Jericho
He'd march around those walls
And on his horn he'd blow
That horn would play a tune
And sing a happy song
When Joshua got through
Those walls came tumbling down
You got to sing you children sing
Sing you children sing
I only know one thing, hey! hey! hey!
Sing you children sing, everybody
Sing you children sing
Sing your troubles away
You got to sing your troubles away
Sing your troubles away
Sing your troubles away
Sing your troubles away
Sing your troubles away
You're not a dream, you're not an angel, you're a woman
I'm not a king, just a man, take my hand
We'll make a space in this lives that we planned
And here we'll stay until it's time for you to go
Yes, we're different worlds apart, we're not the same
We laughed and played at the start like in a game, oh Lord
You could have stayed outside my heart but in you came
And here you'll stay until it's time for you to go
Don't ask why
Don't ask how
Don't ask forever
Lord love me, love me, love me, love me now
This love of mine has no beginning, it has no end
I was an oak now I'm a willow and I can bend
And tho' I'll never in my life see you again
Here I stay until it's time for you to go
Oh yes, I'll stay until it's time for you to go
How can you lose what you never had
I tell myself when I'm feeling sad
You don't have the right to cry
You believed your own lie
It's your fault because
You thought that she was yours
Think it over once, think it over twice
I wish I could take my own advice
I know I should be glad, why does it hurt so bad
How can you lose what you never had
You don't have the right to cry
You believed your own lie
It's your fault because
You thought that she was yours
Think it over once, think it over twice
I wish I could take my own advice
I know I should be glad, why does it hurt so bad
How can you lose what you never had
How can you lose what you never had
All the words that I let her know
Still could not say
How much I need you so in every way
I hope you will guide me
As only you can do
Hold my hands down beside me
I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you dear
From the dawn of each day
To always come through dear
In your kind lovin' way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel things you do
Then you know how completely
I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you dear
Around the dawn of each day
To always come true, dear
In your kind lovin' way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel things you do
Then you know how completely
I'm counting on you
Just leave it to me
Don't ever be ashamed
Just give me a chance
I'll take care of everything
Your troubles I'll share
Let me know and I'll be there
I'll stay close to you
Anyplace and anywhere
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand if you can
Be truthful to me,
I'll be truthful to you
I'm in love with you so
Till I don't know what to do
So, let's call it a day
I said all I have to say
Except don't forget to pray
And shake a hand ev'ry day
Shake a hand, shake a hand,
Shake a hand if you can
I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad
Won't you play for me a down home country song
'Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off
With a barefoot ballad you just can't go wrong
Give me a honk-tonk fiddle with a guitar in the middle and a melody
Humming like a fountain swinging out on Smokey mountain
I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad
Won't you play for me a down home country song
'Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off
With a barefoot ballad you just can't go wrong
Now the big toe's connected to the two toe
And the two toe's connected to the three toe
And the three toe's connected to the four toe
And the four toe's connected to the five toe
And the five toe and away we go
I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad
Won't you play for me a down home country song
'Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off
With a barefoot ballad you just can't go wrong
Now the big toe's connected to the two toe
And the two toe's connected to the three toe
And the three toe's connected to the four toe
And the four toe's connected to the five toe
And the five toe and away we go
I wanna barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad
Won't you play for me a barefoot ballad song
(words & music red west)
I'll hold you tight in the moonlight tonight
I love you mary lou brown
Twinkeling stars told the milky white way
That I marry mary lou brown
And I will tell all the world
Of my young southern girl,
See her tonight beyond moonlight
So I can hold mary tight
I'll bring my guitar to the moonlight tonight
I love you mary lou brown
Imagine your heart floating right up the sigh (? )
I love you mary lou brown
Down by the green river side with my arms open wide
I'll wait for her, only for her
Mary lou brown's mine tonight
Mary lou brown's mine tonight
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
And how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the seas
How many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head
Pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Won't you wear my ring around your neck?
To tell the world I'm yours, by heck
Let them see your love for me
And let them see by the ring around your neck
Won't you wear my ring around your neck?
To tell the world I'm yours, by heck
Let them know I love you so
And let them no by the ring around your neck
Well they say that goin' steady is not the proper thing
They say that we're too young to know the meaning of a ring
I only know that I love you and that you love me too
So, darling, please do what I ask of you
Won't you wear my ring around your neck
To tell the world I'm yours, by heck
Let them see your love for me
And let them see by the ring around your neck
Well they say that goin' steady is not the proper thing
They say that we're too young to know the meaning of a ring
I only know that I love you and that you love me too
So, darling, this is what I, I beg of you
Won't you wear my ring around your neck
To tell the world I'm yours, by heck
Let them know I love you so
And let them know by the ring around your neck
And let them know by the ring around your neck
And let them know by the ring around your neck
I remember how your eyes used to light up
Over promises that I made
But for the first time in my life
I know now how it feels to be afraid
I don't know what I'd do if you go away
This would sure be one lonely old town
For a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love coming down
Love coming down
I remember all the times you told me
Love's all that matters to you
And looking back now, wondering how I believed
I had things more important to do
I can see how I must have looked to you
Like some fool on a merry-go-round
And that a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love going down
Love going down
Can't you see how everything I've learned
Would just be wasted if you leave me
If you just give one more try
I swear I'll always be here when you need me
If you can find it in your heart to forgive me
I'll try to keep both my feet on the ground
But if a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love coming down
Love coming down
You belong to my heart now and forever
We were there beneath the stars while a million guitars
Played our love song
When they said I love you
Every beat of my heart said it too
Do you remember 
Darling you'll hear that song
And you'll always belong to my heart
What's in the drink, chase the Devil away
Magic I think so I just say Chesay
Chesay, Chesay bring you good luck night and day
Chesay, Chesay that's the gypsy way
Trouble is my middle name
Though it's such a crying shame

But I'm feeling kinda strange
Feel like things are going to change
Time my lucky star was shining through
Chesay, Chesay bring you good luck night and day
Chesay, Chesay that's the gypsy way
Drink a cup of gypsy love
Just tip it up and then you just say Chesay
Swallow once then swallow twice
Goes down so nice just say Chesay, hey
What's in the drink, chase the Devil away
Magic I think so I just say Chesay
Chesay, Chesay bring you good luck night and day
Chesay, Chesay that's the gypsy way
Chesay, Chesay brings you good luck night and day
Chesay, Chesay that's the gypsy way
Chesay, Chesay brings you good luck night and day
Chesay, Chesay that's the gypsy way

You're so young and beautiful and I love you so
Your lips so red, your eyes that shine
Shame the stars that glow
So fill these lonely arms of mine
And kiss me tenderly
Then you'll be forever young
And beautiful to me
You're so young and beautiful, you're everything I love
Your angel smile, your gentle touch
Are all I'm dreaming of
Oh take this heart I offer you
And never set me free
Then you'll be forever young
And beautiful to me
She's sitting right over there, I'd know that face anywhere
I'd run up and embrace her but I'm ashamed to face her
Just tell her Jim said hello
I'd like to pour out my heart but I don't know where to start
I'd like to tell her what I'm really feeling but
Just tell her Jim said hello
Just tell her Jim said hello
Just tell her Jim and she'll know
Don't tell her I'm feeling blue that's just between me and you
Don't say I'm thinking of her, don't tell her that I still love her
Just tell her Jim said hello
Just tell her Jim said hello
Just tell her Jim said hello
Just tell her Jim said hello
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real
I'm crying
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
Oh let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When honey, you know
I've never lied to you
Mmm yeah, yeah
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Ã¢Â¦
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loves me
When I am disgraced now I'm feeling the gloom
God sends His Angel to see Him in my room
I hear their singing, I'm satisfied
I know, I know that Jesus is mine
Oh, how I love Jesus
  (Oh, He is so wonderful)
Oh, how I love Jesus
  (Oh, He is so wonderful)
Oh, how I love Jesus
  (Oh, He is so wonderful)
To know that Jesus is mine
Oh, how I love Jesus
  (Oh, He is so wonderful)
Oh, how I love Jesus
  (Oh, He is so wonderful)
Oh, how I love Jesus
  (Oh, He is so wonderful)
To know that Jesus is mine
When Moses walked the children out of Egypt land
Said now don't you worry, we're in the Lord's hands
He's gonna walk beside us, the time is comin' near
He's gonna wash away all our misery and our fear
I got a feelin' in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be releasing all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way
When Daniel faced the lion
There wasn't any doubt
You got to be like Daniel
And the Lord will help us out
I got a feelin' in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be releasing all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way
Won't you lift your eyes up children
Lift them to the sky
Heaven stands before you
Gates are open wide
Shelter for the weary
Comfort for the weak
We'll leave the devil's evil
Sweatin' on the street
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta
I got a feelin' in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be releasing all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way
Won't you lift your eyes up children
Lift them to the sky
Heaven stands before you
Gates are open wide
Shelter for the weary
Comfort for the weak
Leave the devils evil
Sweatin' on the street
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta
I got a feelin' in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be releasing all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know right now, I wanna know
Yeah, yeah, I got a feel
I got a feelin', I got a feelin'
I got a feelin' in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be releasing all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way
AllÃÂ¡ en el rancho grande
AllÃÂ¡ donde vÃÂ­vÃÂ­a
HablÃÂ¡ una rancherita
Que alegre me decÃÂ­a
Que alegre me decÃÂ­a
Te voy hacer unas calzones
comos los que esa el ranchero
Los comenzo de lana
Y los acabo de hierro
I have wished for the wealth
Of a great millionaire
I have reached for a bright star above
But the thrill of it all
To me seems so small
When compared to the thrill of your love
I'd rather give everything 
That I own in this world 
Than to be all alone and unloved
For no earthly price and no sacrifice
Is too much to give 
For your love 
I'd rather give everything 
That I own in this world 
Than to be all alone and unloved
For no earthly price and no sacrifice
Is too much to give 
For your love
Out of sight, out of mind
So the story goes
You forgot I exist
My broken heart knows
When out of sight then it's out of mind
Especially when you found somebody new
But I can't change my love
Umm umm, the way that you do
I sit around and wonder
About your new love affair
That's what you call lookin' back
I should forget to remember
And remember not to care
I'd forget if I could
But my heart is blind
You are gone out of sight
But you're lingering in my mind
Out of sight but not out of my mind
To dream the impossible dream 
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear the unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
To write the unwritable wrong
To be better far than you are
To try when your arms are too weary
The reach the unreachable star
This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless,
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Whithout question or pause
To be willing to march into hell
For a heavenly cause
And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will be peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest
And the world would be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star
Ho jump down, spin around, let's have a party
Look who's back, Stay Away Joe
Chock taw, chick a Shaw, gonna drink me hearty
Welcome back, Stay Away Joe
Stay Away Joe they call me
Stay Away Joe, oh yeah
But if you need me call me
Hoop and a holler and I'll be there
Ho
Who keeps turnin' up like a bad penny
Take one guess, Stay Away Joe
Always findin' trouble a-plenty
Oh my yes, I reckon you know
Stay Away Joe they call me
Stay Away Joe, oh yeah
But if you need me call me
Hoop and a holler and I'll be there
Ho
When two lips are right for the pickin'
Who crops up, Stay Away Joe
I love them and leave them screamin' 'n kickin'
Giddy up look at him look at him go
Stay Away Joe they call me
Stay Away Joe, oh yeah
But if you need me call me
Hoop and a holler and I'll be there
Hey
(Christmas, Christmas, Christmas)
Well, it's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is fallin' on the ground
(Christmas, Christmas)
Well, it's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is on the ground
(Christmas, Christmas)
Well, you be a real good little girl
Santa Claus is back in town
(Christmas, Christmas)
Got no sleigh with reindeer, no sack on my back
You're gonna see me comin' in a big black Cadillac
Whoa oh, it's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is fallin' on the ground
(Christmas, Christmas)
Well, you be a real good little baby
Santa Claus is back in town
(Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas)
Hang up your pretty stockings, turn off the light
Santa Claus is comin' down your chimney tonight
Whoa oh oh oh, it's Christmas time pretty baby
(Christmas)
And the snow is fallin' on the ground
(Christmas, wah wah wah wah wah Christmas)
Well, you be a real good little baby
Santa Claus is back in town
(Christmas, Christmas, Christmas)
My baby's long and tall,
She's like a cannonball.
Say, everytime she loves me,
Lordly, you can hear me squall.
She cried, Ooo-wee.
I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living".
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine".
My baby knows just how
To treat me right.
Gives me plenty loving 
Morning, noon, and night.
She cried, Ooo-wee.
I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living".
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine".
When my baby does what she does to me,
I climb the highest mountain,
Dive in the deepest sea.
She cried, Ooo-wee.
I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living".
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine".
My baby's lips are red
And sweet like wine,
And when she kisses me,
I get high every time.
She cried, Oo-wee.
I believe I'll change my mind.
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living".
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine".
They call me poor boy, poor boy, poor boy
But I ain't lonesome and I ain't blue
'Cause I could never be a poor boy
As long as I've got a dolly like you
Ain't got a crust, ain't got a cent
Can't buy a jug, can't pay the rent
I got a heartfull of dreams
And a lot of memories
And that's enough for me
Can't buy a house, can't buy a lot
Ain't got a bean, I ain't got a pot
But what I got is a heartfull of
Love and memories
And that's enough for me
Don't have a pig, don't have a cow
I don't have a horse to pull a plow
But what I got is a heartfull of
Love and memories
And that's enough for me
When trouble is in my way
I can't tell the night from day
I'm tossed from side to side
Like a ship on a raging tide
I don't worry and I don't fret
God has never failed me yet
Troubles comin' from time to time
But that's all right, 'cause I'm not the worrying kind
Because I, I've got confidence,
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me
Job was so sick oh so long
Till the flesh fell from his bones
His wife, cattle and children,
Everything that he had was gone
But Job, in his despair,
He knew that God still cared
Sleepless days and sleepless nights
Job said, honey, that's all right
'Cause I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me
Some folks wonder how I smile
Even though I'm going through a trial
How can I have song
When everything is going wrong
I don't worry and I don't fret
God has never failed me yet
Trouble's coming from time to time
That's all right, I'm not the worrying kind
Chorus (repeats to fade)
We've got to patch it up baby
Before we fall apart at the seams
We've got to patch it up baby
We can't let time unravel our dreams
Let's go back touch the past
One more night is all I ask
Get that feelin', that old feelin', feel it healin'
We can patch it up baby
We can patch it up baby
We can patch it up baby
Patch it up, with a whole lotta love
We've got to patch it up baby
Let's sweep out all the cupboards of our heart
We've got to patch it up baby
Before indifference pulls us apart
Let's don't let a good love die
Let's give it one more try
With that feelin' that old feelin', feel it healin'
We can patch it up baby
We can patch it up baby
We can patch it up baby
Patch it up with a whole lotta love
...
732. When God Dips His Love in My Heart
[Million Dollar Quartet]
(Traditional)
 
When God dips His pen of love in my heart
And writes my soul a message, He wants me to know
His Spirit, all divine, fills this sinful soul of mine
When God Dips His Love In My Heart.
 
Well, I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soulÃÂ¥ÃÂ½
 
 
I've gotta gal, oh what a pal
The apple of my eye
With something rare, a peach of a pear
But her dad won't let us meet and I could die
I love Petunia the gardener's daughter
Oooh how that gal can kiss
Her eyes are blue as bluebells
Each cheek a rose to see
How I dance when she plants her two lips on me
I'm as daffy as a daffodil
I long to kiss her all the time
Tonight I'll steal into her garden
And make Petunia's two lips mine
(I've got a beau, I love him so
The apple of my eye
With something rare, a peach of a pear
But my dad won't let us meet and I could die)
And we could die
I love Petunia the gardener's daughter
Oooh how that gal can kiss
(My eyes are blue as bluebells
Each cheek a rose to see)
How I dance when she plants her two lips on me
(He's as daffy as a daffodil
He loves to kiss me all the time)
Tonight I'll steal into her garden
And make Petunia's two lips mine
She makes other girls look just like weeds
(I'm gonna be his clinging vine)
Tonight I'll steal into her garden
And make Petunia's two lips
(My ever loving two lips)
Make Petunia's two lips mine
I'm riding the rainbow
Hitting the highway to happiness
Oh yes, I'm looking to find someone
Whose meant to be mine
I'm living to love and loving to live
I've got a heart, I'm longing to give
I'm riding the rainbow
I'll follow that star to where you are
I'm riding the rainbow
Heading for heaven and happiness
I guess somebody somewhere
Someday will teach me to care
But being alone
Don't bother me
I'm free to have fun
It's fun to be free
I'm riding the rainbow
I'll follow that star
I'm riding the rainbow
To where you are
(words & music by Blackwell - Scott)
Do you or don't you love me
Such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer
Tell me, will you or won't you need me
Such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer
All you do is give a sigh
And beat around the bush
Can it be that you're too shy
To give yourself a little old push
Can you or can't you tell me yes
It's such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer
(words & music by lange - heath - burke)
Who made the mountains, who made the trees
Who made the rivers flow to the sea
And who sends the rain when the earth is dry
Somebody bigger than you and i
Who made the flowers to bloom in the spring
Who made the song for the robins to sing
And who hung the moon and the stars in the sky
Somebody bigger than you and i
He lights the way when the road is long
He keeps you company
And with his love to guide you
He walks beside you
Just like he walks with me
When we're filled with despair
Who gives me courage to go from there
And who gives me faith that will never die
Somebody bigger than you and i
May this tenderness cling
When the fire of Spring
Is a memory
May you still be my own
When a hundred years have flown
But if it can't be
Give this moment to me
While our dream is bright
Put your sweet arms around me
And love me tonight
Love me tonight
Let me feel your lips on mine
And though I pray
Forever and a day I'll be
Possessing you
I'll confess to you
If I knew that our love would be gone
With the stars in the dawn's grey light
I'd still hold you close and whisper
Love me tonight
A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation aint satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby
Baby close your eyes and listen to the music
Drifting through a summer breeze
Its a groovy night and I can show you how to use it
Come along with me and put your mind at ease
A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation aint satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby
Come on baby Im tired of talking
Grab your coat and lets start walking
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Dont procrastinate, dont articulate
Girl its getting late, gettin upset waitin around
A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation aint satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby
If I could be you, if you could be me
For just one hour
If we could find a way to get inside
Each other's mind
If you could see you through my eyes
Instead your ego
I believe you'd be, I believe you'd be surprised to see
That you've been blind
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
Now there are people on reservations
And out in the ghetto
And brother there, but for the grace of god
Go you and I
If I only had the wings
Of a little angel
Don't you know, I'd fly to the top of a mountain
And then I'd cry, cry, cry
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
She sells sea shells by the seashore
But I know a girl who sells so much more
Queenie Wahine's Papaya rates higher than pineapple, pumpkin or poy
Please pick her papaya put Queenie Wahine in perfect perpetual joy
'Though some people's palates prefer pickled salads
For pudding pick popcorn peach pie
Oh Queenie's papaya you'll truly desire
When that Queenie Wahine passes by
Queenie Wahine's Papaya rates higher than pineapple, pumpkin or poy
Please pick her papaya put Queenie Wahine in perfect perpetual joy
'Though some people's palates prefer pickled salads
For pudding pick popcorn peach pie
Oh Queenie's papaya you'll truly desire
When that Queenie Wahine passes by
Queenie Wahine's Papaya rates higher than pineapple, pumpkin or poy
Please pick her papaya put Queenie Wahine in perfect perpetual joy
'Though some people's palates prefer pickled salads
For pudding pick popcorn peach pie
Oh Queenie's papaya you'll truly desire
When that Queenie Wahine passes by
Her eyes tell the story so well
She tries hard to hide
So little expected too often neglected
A woman stripped of her pride
Always so careful not to cry
Until I fall asleep
And there in the silence
She lies with a tear on her cheek
The thought comes to mind that I've relived somehow
For herein I can't quite recall
That a man without love's only half a man
But a woman is nothing at all
She knows I don't love her
Although heaven knows how I try
Her reason for living is to go right on giving
One thing that she's gon' be mine
Without any warning in the wee hours
Of the morning, she cries
Her deep inside she cries so to hide
Is beginning to show in her eyes
And a thought comes to mind that I've relived sometime
For herein I can't quite recall
That a man without love's only half a man
But a woman is nothing at all
Yeah, a man without love's only half a man
But a woman is nothing at all
A very old friend came by today
'Cause he was telling everyone in town
Of the love that he just found
And Marie's the name of his latest flame
He talked and talked and I heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
The prettiest green eyes anywhere
And Marie's the name of his latest flame
Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burnin
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returnin
What else was there for me to do but cry
Would you believe that yesterday
This girl was in my arms and swore to me
She'd be mine eternally
And Marie's the name of his latest flame
Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burnin
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returnin
What else was there for me to do but cry
Would you believe that yesterday
This girl was in my arms and swore to me
She'd be mine eternally
And Marie's the name of his latest flame
Yeah Marie's the name of his latest flame
Oh Marie's the name of his latest flame.
I'm playin' for keeps
This time it's real
And I want you to know
Exactly how I feel
I'm playin' for keeps
I'm sure this time
And I won't be happy
Until I know you're mine
There have been others
That could love me true
But no one else can thrill me like you do
I'm playin' for keeps
Oh love me too
Oh, don't make me sorry
That I fell in love with you
There have been others
That could love me true
But no one else can thrill me like you do
I'm playin' for keeps
Oh love me too
Oh, don't make me sorry
That I fell in love with you
Hawaii, U.S.A., Hawaii..U.S.A..
We're flyin', comin' your way
Aloha, Hawaii U.S.A.
Gee it's great, to be in that fiftieth state
The land of enchanted dreams
What an isle, where it's heaven tropical style
Where love weaves a spell, it seems
Hawaii, U.S.A., Hawaii..U.S.A..
We're flyin', comin' your way
Aloha, Hawaii U.S.A.
Gee what fun, just to swim and surf in the sun
While the trade winds caress the sea
What a sight, those exotic scenes of delight
Are waiting for you and me
Hawaii, U.S.A....Hawaii...U.S.A...Hawaii..U.S.A....
Say you're mine, then ask me what you will
All your dreams, my darling I'll fulfill
Golden coins, I will bring to you
Silver trinkets and rubies too
In return dear I'm begging you
For the pleasures of love
I'll bring gifts, like you never saw
Priceless garments that you'll adore
Persian rugs to enhance your floor
For the pleasures of love
Darling, choose anything you please
Rich brocade, or woven tapestries
In exchange, I plead on my knees
For the pleasure of love
Golden coins, I'll place at your feet
Precious jewels to make life complete
All my treasures are yours my sweet
For the pleasures of love
I want my share of love, it might as well be known
But I ain't thinking of one girl to love alone
That ain't the way it's gonna be, I'm on my own and I am free
And I've been satisfied, so I don't wanna be tied
Somebody's loving arms can sure be sweet I've found
But I want no-one's arms to ever hold me down
Once I get caught inside a net I'm gonna run I bet
I'm gonna run and hide, I don't wanna be tied
I've seen lovers who were matched, they thought that love could stay
Once they cared and got attached, it seems that love just slipped away
Don't want no claims on me, 
don't want no chains that bind 
As anyone could see 
I say what's on my mind
Well there ain't nothing I conceal, I'm gonna play the field
The field of love is wide , 
I don't wanna be tied 
The field of love is wide, 
I don't wanna be tied 
The field of love is wide,
I don't wanna be tied 
I said I don't, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be tied
With eyes that hide the man within
You see behind the eyes of, other men
You've lived and died and come to life again
And now you stand alone at the crossroads of your mind
You've left your yesterdays behind..
But which road leads you to tomorrow?
Charro...
You've turned your back on yesterday
Betrayed a man who swore he'd make you pay
For when you left you took his pride away
You know he'll never let you break away so easily
You'll have to fight, before you're free
But how much more time can you borrow?
Charro...
Now in a single moment your past grows dim
One thought goes racing across your mind
You ride to meet the woman you stole from him
Oh no!...Charro don't go!...
Charro don't go!!...
There's something hanging, in the wind
Your past is catching up and closing in
You've been halfway to hell and back again
And now you laugh in the devil's face
with your last breath...
You'll run a race with life and death...
But will you live to see tomorrow?
Charro
It's knowin' that your door is always open
And you path is free to walk
That makes me tend to keep my sleeping bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch
It's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
I had the heat stains that have dried up on some lovin'
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
It keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we'd fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursin'
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours
You're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence 'til the join might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you
Walking in the back roads
By the rivers flowing gently on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurgling
Cracking cauldron in some train yard
I'm barely runnin' cold how
Have a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands around the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smiling never changes on my mind
I remember as a child I used to hear
Music that they played Lord with a feel
Some call it folk, some call it soul
But people let me tell you it was rock and roll
I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
Every day when I got home I turned on my radio
Listening to the music that my idols made
I knew every single record the DJ's played
A honky tonk a Hound Dog, a Johnny B. Goode
Chain Gang, Love Is Strange, Knock On Wood
I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat, I was made for rock and roll
I thought it was a fad, thought that it would pass
But the younger generation knew it would last
Time's gone by, the beat goes on
But every time I hear it Lord it takes me home
I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
Every day when I got home I turned on my radio
Mother played recordings of Beethoven's Fifth
Mozart's sonatas down the classical Liszt
My papa loved to listen to those country songs
While I was in the back room rockin' on
I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat, I was made for rock and roll
I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat, I was made for rock and roll
I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
Show me a girl with a dimple on her cheek
Butter melts in her mouth when she opens it to speak
Show me a girl who is acting so refined
And I'll show you a girl with one thing on her mind
So I say, "You know what?"
She says, "What?", I say, "What?
Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"
"For you've got what it takes
And it takes what you've got
But I'm not the marrying kind"
"Don't kiss me, don't claw me
Don't pet me, don't paw me
I won't leave my freedom behind"
So I say, "You know what?"
She says, "What?", I say, "What?
Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"
"You know what?", She says, "What?"
I say, "What? Thanks a lot
But I'm not the marrying kind"
"Don't kiss me, don't claw me
Don't pet me, don't paw me
And I won't leave my freedom behind"
So I say, "You know what?"
She says, "What?", I say, "What?
Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"
"I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
Now you've got what I'm not
I'm not the marrying kind"
"Oh, I'm not the marrying kind
Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"
All right
I've been thumbin' rides travellin' light
Walked the streets till past midnight
Trampin' roads, trails and lanes
Scaling cliffs fields and plains
Searchin' till the early dawn
For that long legged girl with the short dress on
Riding trucks, bikes and skis
Sailing lakes and brooks and seas
Driving wagons, cars and jeeps
Walking stilts in ten foot leaps
Searchin' till the early dawn
For that long legged girl with the short dress on
And everywhere I go she's been and gone
She's fine, it's just too bad she's the travellin' kind
So fine, I just can't rest till I make her mine
I've been from Maine to Tennessee, Mexico from Wahkiki
Rain or shine, sleet or snow
Searchin' high, searchin' low
Everything depends upon
That long legged girl with the short dress on
She's fine, it's just too bad she's the travellin' kind
So fine, I just can't rest till I make her mine
I've been from Maine to Tennessee, Mexico from Wahkiki
Rain or shine, sleet or snow
Searchin' high, searchin' low
Everything depends upon
That long legged girl with the short dress on
The long legged girl with the short dress on
I've got to find my baby
I wonder where can she be
Has anybody seen her
Send her back to me
She left me here all alone
And I ain't had no lovin' 
Since my baby's been gone
My baby's gone
I've gotta find my baby
I gotta hold her tight and tell her I love her
Tell her everything's all right
So I'll keep searching
All night long
'Cause I ain't had no lovin' 
Since my baby's been gone
My baby's gone 
I've gotta find my baby
I've gotta find my baby
Gotta find my baby
Lord, help me walk another mile, just one more mile
I'm tired of walkin' all alone
Lord, help me smile another smile, just one more smile
You know I just can't make it on my own
I never thought I needed help before
I thought that I could get by, by myself
But now I know I just can't take it any more
With a humble heart, on bended knee
I'm beggin' You, please, help me
Come down from your golden throne to me, to lowly me
I need to feel the touch of Your tender hand
Remove the chains of darkness let me see, Lord let me see
Just where I fit into Your master plan
I never thought I needed help before
I thought that I could get by, by myself
But now I know I just can't take it any more
With a humble heart, on bended knee
I'm beggin' You, please, help me
With a humble heart, on bended knee
I'm beggin' You, please, help me
Starting today
I'm teaching my heart
Not to ache anymore
Just 'cause we're apart
No more will I dream
Of your sweet loving ways
Gonna learn to forget you
Starting today
And when memories haunt me
And the tears starts to flow
I'll just think of the sorrow
You caused me to know
No more for the past
To return will I pray
Gonna live for tomorrow
Starting today
Starting today
(words & music by S. Kesler - C. Feathers)
I forgot to remember to forget her,
I can't seem to get her off my mind.
I thought I'd never miss her,
But I found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time.
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we ever met.
But something sure is wrong,
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely.
I forgot to remember to forget.
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we ever met,
Well, but something sure is wrong,
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely.
I forgot to remember to forget.
Happy ending, happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then they never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
Our love story gets me so upset
Like Romeo and Juliet
I'm not smart enough to figure why
Some folks enjoy a real good cry
Happy ending, happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then they never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
  (You and me, you and me, you and me, you and me)
Never thought that I would stand a chance
That you'd give me a second glance
But I think that you can play the part
And give a guy a happy heart
Happy ending, happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then they never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
  (You and me, you and me)
When boy meets girl and then they never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
  (You and me)
Like you and me, like you and me
  (You and me, you and me, like you and me)
If you're in old habits
Set in your old ways
Changes are a-comin'
For these are changing days
And if your head is in the sand
While things are goin' on
What you need, what you need
What you need is a change of habit
Now if you're in the habit
To let your temper fly
When you talk with people
Who don't see eye to eye
And if you don't believe it
There's a newer world ahead
What you need, what you need
What you need is a change of habit
A change of habit, a change of outlook
A change of heart, you'll be alright
The halls of darkness, have doors that open
It's never too late to see the light
So if you're in the habit
Putting people down
Just because they're different
From the wrong side of town
Well, don't count on any medals, son
They're pinning none on you
What you need, what you need
What you need is a change of habit
A change of habit, a change of outlook
A change of heart, you'll be alright
The halls of darkness, have doors that open
It's never too late to see the light
So if you're in the habit
Of putting people down
Just because they're different
From the wrong side of town
Well, don't count on any medals, son
They're pinning none on you
What you need, what you need
What you need is a change of habit
Change of habit, hmm, change of habit
Change of habit
No lyrics
Never found a four leaf clover
To bring good luck to me
No rabbit's foot, no lucky star
No magic wishing tree
But I got lucky, yes, I got lucky
  (I got lucky, lucky when)
When I found you, oh oh, yeah
Got no rainbow around my shoulder
No horseshoe on my door
But I got you to hold me tight
And who could ask for more
Oh, I got lucky, yes, I got lucky
  (I got lucky, lucky when)
When I found you
(When I found you)
I always walk around
With all my fingers crossed
I'm afraid the love I found
Just might get lost
So won't you tell me that you love me
Hurry up and name the day
And then I'll know that my good luck
Is really here to stay
Oh, I got lucky, yes, I got lucky
  (I got lucky, lucky when)
When I found you
(I found you)
I always walk around
With all my fingers crossed
I'm afraid the love I found
Just might get lost
So won't you tell me that you love me
hurry up and name the day
And then I'll know that my good luck
Is really here to stay
Oh, I got lucky, yes, I got lucky
  (I got lucky, lucky when)
When I found you
(I found you)
Oh, I got lucky, yes, I got lucky
  (I got lucky)
When I found you
Merry, merry Christmas, baby
Sure did treat me nice
I said merry Christmas, baby
Sure did treat me nice
Gave me diamond rings for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I want to kiss you, baby
While you're standing 'neath the mistletoe
I said, merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice, yes, you did
Yes, you did, yes, you did, yes, you did
I said merry, merry Christmas baby
Sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise
I said, merry, merry, merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice
I said, merry, merry Christmas, baby
Girl, you sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm puttin' it through Al's mike
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I want to kiss you, baby
While you're standing 'neath the mistletoe
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my, on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I want to kiss you, baby
Underneath your mistletoe
I said merry Christmas, baby
Girl, you sure did treat me nice
I said, merry, merry Christmas, baby
Girl, you sure did treat me nice
The day you said we'd never part
You turned around and broke my heart
You had the nerve to tell me I would soon forget
Now you've been gone away one year
And I have not forgotten dear
The love I had for you so long
Is still here 
Wow-oh
It's here, still here
Because my heart cannot believe
We're really through
And though you said we'd never part
You turned around and broke my heart
The love I had for you so long
Is still here
It's here, still here
Because my heart cannot believe
We're really through
Now you've been gone away one year
And I have not forgotten dear
The love I had for you so long
Is still here
Wow-oh
It's here, it's here, still here
Because my heart cannot believe
We're really through
And though you said we'd never part
You turned around and broke my heart
The love I had for you so long
Is still here
Wow-ow
It's here, still here
Because my heart cannot believe
We're really through
And though you said we'd never part
You turned around and broke my heart
The love I had for you so long
Is still here
Oh yeah
I'll go on loving you
Don't ask me why
Don't know what else to do
Don't ask me why
How sad my heart would be
If you should go
Though you're not good for me
I want you so
It's not the kind
Of love I dream about
But it's the kind
That I can't live without
You're all I'm longing for
Don't say good-bye
I need you more and more
Don't ask me why
I need you more and more
Don't ask me why
This was gonna be the night tonight
I was gonna get to hold you tight
But I guess we didn't plan it right
I never stood a chance, we couldn't dance
Cause there's , no room to rhumba in a sports car
You can't move forward or back
There's no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack
When a little kiss I want to steal
I hit my head against the steering wheel
Now I know the way a pretzel feels
All I can do is shout...Hey let me out!!
Cause there's , no room to rhumba in a sports car
You can't move forward or back
There's no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack
What a way to waste a day with you
Nothing happens that can tell the truth
Let's go out and find a telephone booth
Yeah that's a better place, I like more space
Cause there's , no room to rhumba in a sports car
You can't move forward or back
There's no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack
Oh the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl I love
Her eyes are even bluer than Texas skies above
Her heart's as big as Texas and wherever I may go
I'll remember her forever because I love her so
There are so many roses that bloom along the way
But my heart's in Amarillo and that's where it will stay
With the yellow rose of Texas so I'd better get there fast
'Cause I know I was her first love and I want to be her last
Oh the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl I love
Her eyes are even bluer than Texas skies above
Her heart's as big as Texas and wherever I may go
I'll remember her forever because I love her so
The eyes of Texas are upon you all the live long day
The eyes of Texas are upon you, you cannot get away
Do not think you can escape them at night or early in the morn
The eyes of Texas are upon you 'till Gabriel blows his horn
The eyes of Texas are upon you all the live long day
The eyes of Texas are upon you, you cannot get away
Do not think you can escape them at night or early in the morn
The eyes of Texas are upon you 'till Gabriel blows his horn
The eyes of Texas are upon you all the live long day
The eyes of Texas are upon you, you cannot get away
Do not think you can escape them at night or early in the morn
The eyes of Texas are upon you 'till Gabriel blows his horn
I walk along a thin line darling
Dark shadows follow me
Here's where life's dream lies disillusioned 
The edge of reality
Oh I can hear strange voices echo 
Laughing with mockery 
The border line of doom I'm facing 
The edge of reality
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
The girl with the nameless face
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me
With fears that I can't explain
She drove me to the point of madness
The brink of misery 
If she's not real then I'm condemned to
The edge of reality
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
The girl with the nameless face
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me
With fears that I can't explain
She drove me to the point of madness
The brink of misery 
If she's not real then I'm condemned to
The edge of reality
Reality, reality, reality, reality, 
Reality, reality, reality, reality
Do the Vega take a chance and do the vega
If you dance it you'll have fun
The fever gets ya and then I'll bet ya
You'll shake like the sun of a gun
First you make the right connection
Choose the one whose your selection
Though you risk your reputation
You'll increase you're circulation
Do the Vega take a chance and do the vega
If you dance it you'll have fun
The fever gets ya and then I'll bet ya
You'll shake like the sun of a gun
Roll and keep you're shoulders busy
Like a wheel spin 'till you're dizzy
Kick your heels when you've a notion
Shake and shimmy that's the motion
Do the Vega take a chance and do the vega
If you dance it you'll have fun
The fever gets ya and then I'll bet ya
You'll shake like the sun of a gun
Do the Vega take a chance and do the vega
If you dance it you'll have fun
The fever gets ya and then I'll bet ya
You'll shake like the sun of a gun
Shake like the sun of a gun
Shake like the sun of a gun
Shake like the sun of a gun
This is living
Full of fun and free
This is living
That's the life for me
It's good to laugh and sing
Don't worry about a thing
Wear a happy smile
Cut loose and run a mile
If you relax and just enjoy it all
Life has got to be a ball
This is living
Full of fun and free
This is living
That's the life for me
It wouldn't mean a thing
If I could be a king
I really wouldn't care
To be a millionaire
I'd rather find someone to love a lot
Live and give it all I've got
This is living
Full of fun and free
This is living
That's the life for me
Don't wanna settle down
I gotta move around
I gotta lot of time
I'm gonna wait and find
The kinda girl who's heart is restless too
The kind who feels the way I do
This is living
Full of fun and free
This is living
That's the life for me
I told you that some day
If you kept on being untrue
Somebody else would come along
And release me from you
You'll be glad to know now
Your fickle world
Can have its own way
For it finally happened
I've met her today
I used to think I just couldn't live
A day without you
In spite of the thousand doubts and tears
That you put me through
All at once I don't care as much for you
I'm sorry to say
For now there's another
I met her today
How I treasured each smile, each kiss
You gave to me now and then
Well, you needn't be kind to me now
Oh no, not ever again
Just when the last bit of pride in me was gone
Someone heard me pray
And sent me my angel
I met her today
I met her today
No-one's in a hurry
No-one seems to worry
Why they're all so happy is very clear
Every day siesta, every night fiesta
I think I'm gonna like it here
All this lovely scenery
There's more to it than greenery
I know a chance for romance is always near
Mission bells are ringing, everybody's singing
I think I'm gonna like it hear
The sound of laughter from every doorway
Sweet music floating across the square
It seems to say things are going better
Your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air
Down to my last peso, but I'm not afraid to say so
I feel just like a brave, Spanish cavalier
I don't care where we go, so lead on" mi amigo"
I think I'm gonna like it here
Melodias.....lapieras
Your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air
Down to my last peso, but I'm not afraid to say so
I feel just like a brave, Spanish cavalier
I don't care where we go, so lead on" mi amigo"
I think I'm gonna like it here
Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died giving me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison
For something that I never done
It's been one hill after another
And I've climbed them all one by one
Oh but this time, Lord You gave me a mountain
A mountain, I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time
My woman got tired of the heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy
Oh this time, Lord You gave me a mountain
A mountain, I may never climb
It isn't Lord a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time
You gave me a mountain this time
Night rider, night rider
You may think that it's the breeze
Whispering through the lonely trees
But it's only him a'flying round the bend
As the day comes to that end
Night rider, night rider
He came riding to town
As the sun was going down
Saw my baby and he smiled her heart away
Now what will I do today
Cautioned my baby to stay at home
Not to leave mama's side
She laughed when I told her take care, take care
Or you'll share in his midnight ride
Night rider, night rider
Since he stole around the side
I ain't had no peace of mind
Night rider, won't you let my baby be
Come on, send her back to me
Come, praise the Lord for He is good
Mmm, come join in love and brotherhood
We'll hear the word and bring our gifts of bread and wine
And we'll be blessed beneath the sign
So let us pray together, pray together
Pray with the one mighty voice
  (Heavenly voice)
And let us sing together, sing together
Pray and we'll rejoice
(We'll rejoice)
When strangers reach out for your hand
(For your hand)
Respond to them and understand
(Heaven obeyed to understand)
We'll rise as one to calm the storm outside the gate
(We'll calm the storm)
With faith in Him we'll never leave
(Never leave)
So let us pray together, pray together
Pray with the one mighty voice
  (Heavenly voice sing)
And let us sing together, sing together
Pray and we'll rejoice
(We'll rejoice)
(We'll rejoice)
The love of God is on our side
(Love is, love is on our side)
We have the strength to move the tide
(We'll move the tide)
The world will say so, there'll be peace and love for all
(Love for all)
And we must give our brothers love
So let us pray together, pray together
Pray with the one mighty voice
  (Heavenly voice, sing)
And let us sing together, sing together
Pray and we'll rejoice
(We'll rejoice)
We'll rejoice love for all to the Lord
We'll rejoice love for all to the Lord
We'll rejoice love for all to the Lord
We'll rejoice for the Lord
When the storms of life are raging
Stand by me 
When the storms of life are raging
Stand by me
When the world is tossing me
Like a ship out on the sea
Thou who rules wind and water
Stand by me
When I'm growing old and feeble
Stand by me 
When I'm growing old and feeble
Stand by me
When I do the best I can
And my friends misunderstand
Thou who never lost a battle
Stand by me 
Thou who never lost a battle
Stand by me
See them tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
I know  when night has gone
That a new world's born at dawn
I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Drifting, on and on
Moving, on and on
Wandering, on and on
You offered me a penny for my thoughts
And I told you then that woman won't stay caught
But you turned and loved her anyway
She broke your heart and all I've got to say
It's your baby, you rock it
It's your heartache, you bought it
You made the bed your sleeping in
And I'm tired of hearing about it friend
It's your baby you, rock it
Well you cried upon my shoulder like a baby
I'm sorry 'bout your troubles and your lady
But she done you like she done me
And I've used up all my sympathy
It's your baby you, rock it
It's your baby, you rock it
It's your heartache, you bought it
You made the bed your sleeping in
And I'm tired of hearing about it friend
It's your baby you, rock it
Well you may run on for a long time
Run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time
Let me tell you God almighty gonna cut you down
Go tell that long tongued liar, oh well well
Go tell that midnight rider, oh well well
Tell the gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell them God almighty gonna cut them down
Stop God almighty let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dews
Coming down on my bended knees
Talking to the man from Galilee
My God spoke and he spoke so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angel's feet
He put one hand upon my head
Great God almighty let me tell you what he said
Go tell that long tongued liar, oh well well
Go tell that midnight rider, oh well well
Tell the gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell them God almighty gonna cut them down
Run on for a long time, 
Run on for a long time,
Let me tell you God almighty gonna cut you down
You may throw your rock and hide your hand
Working in the dark against your fellow man
As sure as God made the day and the night
What you do in the dark will be brought to the light
You may run and hide, slip and slide
Trying to take the mote from your neighbour's eyes
As sure as God made the rich and poor
You gonna reap just what you sow
Run on for a long time, 
Run on for a long time
Let me tell you God almighty gonna cut you down
Go tell that long tongued liar, oh well well
Go tell that midnight rider, oh well well
Tell the gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell them God almighty gonna cut them down
Some people go to church just to sit in the fire
Trying to make a date with the neighbour's wife
Brother let me tell you as sure as you're born
You better leave that woman alone
Because one of these days mark my word
You think that brother is going to work
And you'll sneak up and knock on that door
That's all brother you'll knock no more
Run on for a long time, 
Run on for a long time
Let me tell you God almighty gonna cut you down
Go tell that long tongued liar, oh well well
Go tell that midnight rider, oh well well
Tell the gambler, rambler, back-biter
Tell them God almighty gonna cut them down
KEEPER OF THE KEY
WITH CARL PERKINS AND JERRY LEE LEWIS
WRITERS HARLAN HOWARD, WYNN STEWART
You have gone and yet I'm still your prisoner
Although you're with your new love I'm not free
For you have placed a lock around my heart dear
And you are the keeper of the key
Love locked inside like mine burns constantly
So darling please come back to me
We'll lock our hearts together for a lifetime
And God will be the keeper of the key
Only you can break the chains that bind me
Only you can end my misery
No one else can dry the tears that blind me
For you are the keeper of the key
Love locked inside like mine...
Feel so bad
Feel like a ball game on a rainy day
Feel so bad
Feel like a ball game on a rainy day
Yes I got my rain check
Shake my head and walk away
Ooo people that's the way I feel
Ooo people that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I want
Then again I think I don't
Sometimes I want to stay here
Then again I want to leave
Sometimes I want to leave here
Then again I want to stay
Yes, I got my train fare
Pack my grip and ride away
Ooo people that's the way I feel
Ooo people that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I want
Then again I think I don't
The day that we wed
You blessed us and said
"May heaven bestow you grace"
There in that holy place
We shared our first embrace
Our cottage was small
But richer than all
The palaces of the king
All day the birds would sing
Our hearts were filled with spring
Padre, padre
What happened to our love so cruel?
Padre, oh padre
In my grief I turn to you
Then he came along
And sang her his song
And won her with honey lies
He of the fiery eyes
Now it's not her that cries
So I will pray
The hours away
And weary my heart has grown
Wondering where love has flown
Counting my beads alone
Padre, oh padre
Please tell me how such things can be
Padre, oh padre
Pray for my love and me
Well, I remember when I was just children
The time the people used to treat the neighbor like a fellow man
And all their singing and big prayer meetings
When a man was proud to walk up and shake his neighbors hand
Oh, you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
Oh, if you ever needed help a friend was there
Some good neighbor help you lift your burden
Mmm, and the simple joys of life a friend would share
Times are harder and the people are changing
Now most folks couldn't tell you who their neighbors are
All their guns are loaded, the front doors are bolted
Ain't this ol' world taking hate and fear just a little too far
Oh, you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
I wish I could go back to the days I'm speaking of
When a friend would meet you and a smile would greet you
What this ol' world needs now is a little old fashioned love
My granddaddy, God rest his soul now
Well, we had a big long talk together the day he died
Said, "Son, this world is full of hate and venom
And I can't wait to leave this ol' place and rest on the other side"
Oh, you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
Well, I'm gonna see all the friends I knew in the good ol' days
We'll have a big hand shaking and sit and talk together
Sit down by the river Jordan and sing our blues away
Oh, you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
Well, I'm gonna see all the friends I knew in the good ol' days
Have a big hand shaking and sit and talk together
Sit down by the river Jordan and sing our blues away
Oh, you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
Well, I'm gonna see all the friends I knew in the good ol' days
We'll have a big hand shaking and sit and talk together
Sit down by the river Jordan and sing our blues away
Arrested on charges of unemployment,
He was sitting in the witness stand
The judge's wife called up the district attorney
Said you free that brown eyed man
You want your job you better free that brown eyed man
Flying across the desert in a twa,
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She been a walkin' thirty miles en route to bombay
To get a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man
Way back in history three thousand years
Back every since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shed a tear
For a brown eyed handsome man
That's what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man
Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man
Milo venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man
Two, three count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Rounding third he was headed for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game; it was a brown eyed handsome man
Do you remember
The love we had for each other?
I was your faithy
I miss you so
Please believe me when I tell you
I just can't stand to see you go
You know
Please understand just how I feel
Your love for me might not reveal
And if you know this time it's real
We understood
I miss you so
Please believe me when I tell you
I just can't stand to see you go
You know
Please understand just how I feel
Come back to me, my love is real
And you will know this timeless feel
Will understand
Will understand
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart was at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A memory from the past came slowly stealing
As I braced your arm and walked so close to you
Oh, heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
My love I offer you now
My heart and all it can give
For just as long as I live I'm yours
No arms but yours dear will do
My lips will always be true
My eyes can only see you, I'm yours
And as the years roll along
Your joy and tears I'll gladly share
And when things go wrong dear
Just hold out your hand and I'll be there
With every beat of my heart
With every breath that I take
Now and forever, sweetheart, I'm yours
I'll be as strong as a mountain
Or weak as a willow tree
Anyway you want me
Well that's how I will be
I'll be as tame as a baby
Or wild as the raging sea
Anyway you want me
Well that's how I will be
In your hands my heart is clay
To take and hold as you may
I'm what you make me
You've only to take me
And in your arms I will stay
I'll be a fool or a wise man
And my darling you hold the key
Yes, anyway you want me
Well that's how I will be, I will be
I memorize the note you sent
Go all the places that we went
I seem to search the whole day through
For anything that's part of you
I kept a ribbon from your hair
A breath of perfume lingers there
It helps to cheer me when I'm blue
Anything that's part of you
Oh, how it hurts to miss you so
When I know you don't love me anymore
To go on needing you
Knowing you don't need me
No reason left for me to live
What can I take, what can I give
When I'd give all of someone new
For anything that's part of you
Now come along with me
We'll do the plantation rock
It's easy as can be
You'll wanna dance round the clock
Well it became a sensation
Rockin' on the plantation
Dancin' in the fields down to each dock
Now do the plantation rock
So come on bend your knees
Twist with ease side to side
Like the swaying trees keep in rhythm
Now have some pep double step
Shake right there like a rockin' chair
And stay with them
Well now you're right at home
Doin' the plantation rock
Just do it as you were shown
You'll wanna dance round the clock
Well just like on the plantation
Folks all over the nation
Started rockin' on each street and block
Gonna do the plantation rock
Do the plantation rock
Do the plantation rock
Do the plantation rock
Do you or don't you love me
Such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer
Tell me, will you or won't you need me
Such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer
All you do is give a sigh
And beat around the bush
Can it be that you're too shy
To give yourself a little old push
Can you or can't you tell me yes
It's such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married, we'll so no man
You can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married, we'll so no man
You can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
I said
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
When you looked into my eyes
I stood there like I was hyp-notised
You sent a feeling to my spine
A feeling warm and smooth and fine
But all I could do were stand there paralyzed
When we kissed, ooh what a thrill
You took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
I felt like grabbin' you real tight
Squeeze and squeeze with all my might
But all I could do was stand there paralyzed
Oh yeah lucky me, I'm singing ev'ry day, o-o-oh
Ever since that day you came my way, o-o-oh
You made my life for me just one big happy game
I'm gay ev'ry morning
At night I'm still the same
Well do you remember that wonderful time
When you held my hand and swore that you'd be mine
In front of preacher you said
"I do" I couldn't say a word for thinking of you
All I could do was stand there paralyzed
Oh, lucky me, I'm singing every day,
ever since the day you came my way, o-o-oh  
You made my life for me just one big happy game  
I'm gay every morning, at night I'm still the same  
Do you remember that wonderful time 
When you held my hand 
And swore that you'd be mine  
In front of the preacher you said " I do",  
I couldn't say a word for thinking of you  
All I could do was stand there paralyzed  
All I could do was stand there paralyzed
I am yours and you are mine, come what may
Love like ours remains divine, come what may
Even though we're miles apart you're living in my lonely heart
At night the teardrops start and all the long long day
I kept your picture near me since you went away
I plant a kiss upon your lips each night and day
Bear in mind and you will find a heart that is true
And I'll be here with you, come what may, all right
I kept your picture near me since you went away
I plant a kiss upon your lips each night and day
Bear in mind and you will find a heart that is true
And I'll be here with you come what may
And I'll be here with you come what may
And I'll be here with you come what may
Come what may, come what may
I'm gonna lay down my burden, down by the riverside,
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
I'm gonna lay down my burden, down by the riverside,
I'm gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more
Well, I'm gonna put on my long white robe, (Where?) down by the riverside (Oh)
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
I'm gonna put on my long white robe, (Where?) down by the riverside
I'm gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more
Well, I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield, (Where?) down by the riverside
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield, (A-ha) down by the riverside
I'm gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more

Hmmm.....
And all the world go free
Now there's a cross for everyone
And there's a cross for me
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in his wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow 
strangely dim
In the light of his wonderful face/ or glory and grace 
Nearer my God thee
Nearer to thee
even though it be a cross
That raiseth me
Nearer my God to thee (this line should be) still all my song shall be
Nearer my God to thee
Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to thee
Like a ship without a compass on a cold lonely sea
No beacon light of love to guide me through
I lost the only treasure that means anything to me
What now, what next, where to?
I thought I had a love that would be mine eternally
I felt so sure you'd be forever true
Now everything I counted on has crumbled under you
What now, what next, where to?
You were part of every dream I dreamed, of everything I planned
How could I know our castles were built upon the sand
Won't heaven send an angel please, to tell me what to do
What now, what next, where to?
What now, what next , where to?
(words & music by joy byers)
When I was a little bitty boy
Sittin' on my papa's knee
I still remember every word my papa said to me
Now boy if you ever meet
A pretty woman walking down the street
You'd better
Stop real still, look both ways
Listen or you'll get in trouble
When you see her go struttin' by
Giving you that evil eye
And she's got a kind of dreamy look
Just enough to get you shook
Now boy don't you lose your head
You pay attention what your papa said
You'd better
Stop real still, look both ways
Listen or you'll get in trouble
All right !
She'll drive you crazy with the way she walks
She'll drive you crazy with the way she talks
And you'll think you're gonna lose your mind
'cause that pretty woman looks so fine
And the very first thing you'll know
You'll be tellin' her you love her so
You'd better stop real still
Earth boy dream of angel
Angel she be sweet and make him have happy heart
In land of love
Angel dream of earth boy, earth boy who'll be true
And love her till sun grow cold in land of love
Angel walk on street
Earth boy walking too
All at once they meet
Oo-oo-oo dreams come true
Now best part of story
Like two doves in land of love we will always be
Happy angel is you
Happy earth boy is me
Angel walk on street
Earth boy walking too
All at once they meet
Oo-oo-oo dreams come true
Now best part of story
Like two doves in land of love we will always be
Happy angel is you
Happy earth boy is me
Earth boy dream of angel
Angel dream of earth boy
Earth boy dream of angel
Angel dream of earth boy
Earth boy dream of angel
Viva el vino, viva el dinero
Viva, Viva
El amor
I like to drink wine, and money is fine
But I like the girls even more
Viva el vino, viva el dinero, viva viva el amor
Some pesos you pass, put wine in her glass
And soon she will say "si senor"
Viva el vino, viva el dinero, viva viva el amor
With wine on your lips and money in your pocket
And your sweetheart in your arms
You're rich as you can be
So lift up your glass, let's sing it all together
Muchachas, caballeros, make this toast with me
We'll drink one more time, with money and wine
Let's drink to the girls we adore
Viva el vino, viva el dinero, viva viva el amor
Sing one more time, money and wine
Let's sing to the girls we adore
Viva el vino, viva el dinero, viva viva...
El amor
Don't be afraid, you and I were made the same little one
And I know what it's like when you feel left out of the game little one
But if you take this helping hand that I lift
Then we can smile together, let's be friends
The world that you see may seem to be a mystery to you
The night may be dark but hope very hard and dreams can come true
You live in silence but for once let's pretend
We're talking here together, let's be friends
You're not alone, I've always known that we'd get along
And someone I know says life is good and He can't be wrong
There's fun and laughter just waiting round the bend
Let's find them now together, let's be friends
Let's find them now together, let's be friends
Baby don't fall in love with me
I'll only bring you grief
Baby, don't set your heart on me
I'll only have to leave
'Cause the north wind flows through my veins
Like my dad there's a dream in my brain
In the morning I'll have to leave again
That's how it is when you inherit the wind
Inherit the wind
Daddy, he was a traveling man
I hardly knew his face
Momma, she cried for him at night
He never stayed in one place
'Cause the north wind flows through my veins
Like my dad there's a dream in my brain
In the morning I'll have to leave again
That's how it is when you inherit the wind
Inherit the wind
Oh I can't give you the love you need
I just won't be here that long
But if you still want me here tonight
I'll love you till the break of dawn
'Cause the north wind flows through my veins
Like my dad there's a dream in my brain
In the morning I'll have to leave again
That's how it is when you inherit the wind
Inherit the wind
Inherit the wind, inherit the wind
All right girls, I'll show you what to do
This boat will sparkle like a diamond when we get through
By the numbers there ain't much time
We're gonna start an assembly line
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
You get the sandpaper, you get the pails
You get the hammer baby, you get the nails
You get the paint, you get the brush
'Cause we're gonna give it the special touch
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
We got a magic potion that will help us win
I don't know how to spell it but dip right in
Blako-oxy-tonic phosphate, it's the latest scoop
But that's all right girls you can call it "Goop"
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Work the sandpaper, hammer that nail
Tote that paintbrush and lift that pail
Get a rhythm going, nice and easy
Come on and use a little elbow greasy
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
O.K. girls, we're all through
I'm gonna tell you what we're gonna do
We'll fall right down and have some fun
And I'm gonna kiss you all one by one
As I walk along, I wonder
What went wrong with our love
Our love that was so strong
And as I still walk by
I think off the times we've had together
While our hearts were young
I'm a-walking in the rain
Hear it falling and I feel the pain
Wishing you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder
(I, I, I, I wonder)
Yo, baby
Why?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
You went away
And I wonder where you will stay
My little runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
I'm a-walking in the rain
Hear it falling and I feel the pain
Wishing you were here by me
To end this misery
I wonder
(I, I, I, I wonder)
Yo, baby
Why?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
You went away and I wonder where you will stay
My little runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
Hello, misfortune, how's my old friend "Mr. Misery"?
I've been away so long
I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me
I got no bed to rest my head
No doors or walls or window pane
Now all I needed was the rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain
Met a little honey
At the Buzzin' Bumble Bee Cafe, yes, I did
One drink and all my money
And that honey bee had flown away
I'm 'bout as low as I can go
I don't really mean to complain
Now all I needed was the rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain
All I needed was this rain
All I needed was the rain
Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses dying
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bye
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so
But if he come and all the roses dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
He'll come here and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ava there for me
And I shall feel, oh soft you tread above me
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall rest in peace until you come to me
(Words & music by Preston Foster / Elvis Presley)

I don't know just what I'd do
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side
When I was drifting (when I was drifting on the sea of a despair)
and I was wandering (I was wandering if Jehovah's up there) 
When Jesus found me,(Jesus found me in my sinful life)
he heard me praying (he heard me praying on my knees at night)
Now I'm singing (Now I'm singing this happy song)
because I'm happy (because I'm happy as I go along)
And I don't know (I don't know) just what I'd do
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side
What would I do, (What would I do when a tear fills my eyes)
what would I do (What would I do when it's my time to die)
Well I'd be lonely, discouraged
Burdened on the way
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side every day
I'd be so friendless (I'd be friendless all alone and blue)
and I'd be helpless (I'd be helpless, wouldn't know what to do)
And I don't know (I don't know) just what I'd do
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side
(What would I do) What would I do when the tears fill my eyes
(What would I do) What would I do when it's my time to die
(I'd be lonely, discouraged, burdened on the way)
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side every day
I'd be so friendless, (I'd be friendless all alone and blue)
I'd be so helpless (I'd be helpless, wouldn't know what to do)
And I don't know (I don't know) just what I'd do
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side every day
If the Lord (wasn't walking) wasn't walking by my side
(wasn't walking by my side)
Who makes my heart beat like thunder?
Who makes my temperature rise?
Who makes me tremble with wonderful rapture
With one burning glance, from her eyes
Marguerita...
Once I was free as a gypsy
A creature too wild to tame
Then suddenly I saw, Marguerita
And I was caught, like a moth in the flame
Marguerita...is her name
Marguerita...
Her lips have made me her prisoner
A slave to her every command
She captivates me, and intoxicates me
With one little touch of her hand
Marguerita....
Sweet...Marguerita...sweet,sweet Marguerita....
Because of love, I'm a hundred feet tall
I can bounce this world like a little old ball
The heaven and earth are now all mine
I've jumped to the moon from cloud number nine
Because, because, because, because of love
Because of love, I'm a mighty big man
I hold the sun in the palm of my hand
Just one leap I can cross the seas
Jump over mountains and fly over trees
Because, because, because, because of love
Well I found love, I found love
That's all that I can say
Oh I'll never, never, I'll never, never
Never let it get away
Because of love, I'm the happiest guy
And life is sweet as cherry cream pie
Well heaven and earth are now all mine
I've jumped to the moon from cloud number nine
Because, because, because, because of love
Because, because, because, because of love
Maybe it's too late
Sometimes even hate myself
For loving you
Trying to be strong
Then night time comes along
And I start loving you, wanting you
Where is all my self control?
I'm burning way down in my soul
And needing you
Wishing I could be the man I try to
Hating me for wanting to be with you
Knowing you don't love me like you used to
But it's midnight, oh, and I miss you
It's getting late and I know
That's when I am weak
Funny how things have a way
Of looking so much brighter in the daylight
I hope to go to bed
And try to straighten out my head
And just forget you
Oh, but it's midnight and I miss you
It's getting late and I know
That's when I am weak
Funny how things have a way
Of looking so much brighter in the daylight
I hope to go to bed
And try to straighten out my head
And just forget you
Oh, but it's midnight and I miss you
It's midnight and I miss you
Some of you all never been down South too much
Some of you all never [Incomprehensible]
I' gonna tell you a little story
So you'll understand where I'm talking about
Down there, we have a plant that grows out in the woods and the fields
And it looks some like a turnip green
Everybody calls it Polk salad, now, that's Polk salad
Used to know a girl that lived down there and
She'd go out in the evenings and pick a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause that's about all they had to eat
But they did all right
Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grew so mean
Lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad, Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the Mama was a working on the Chain Gang
What a mean, vicious woman
Everyday before supper time
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of Polk salad
And carry it home in a tote sack
Polk salad, Annie
'Gators got you granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the Mama was a working on the Chain Gang
How wretched, dis spiteful, straight razor, totin' woman
Lord, have mercy
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what
But daddy was a lazy and a no count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for
Stealing watermelons out of my truck
For once Polk salad, Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the Mama was a working on the Chain Gang
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
Sock a little
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Chic a bon, chic a bon
Chic a bon bon bon bon
Chic a bon, chic a bon
Chic a bon bon bon bon
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
Sock a little Polk salad
You know what meets a meal
Chinc, chinc, chinc, chin, ling, ling ling
Chinc, chinc, chinc, chin, ling, ling ling
Chinc, chinc, chinc, chin, ling, ling ling
Chinc, chinc, chinc, chin, ling, ling ling
Gently your eyes met mine
Tender, trusting, true
Gently your hand took mine
Thrilled me through and through
Gently, oh so gently
Gentle as the dawn
Gently, oh so gently
Our true love was born
Gently your lips kissed mine
As we strolled along
Gently your heart touched mine
Young and warm and strong
Gently the hour is near
When true loves have to part
Gently we'll meet again
One more kiss, sweetheart
When your asleep beside me, I watch you lying there
Your hand upon the pillow and moonlight in your hair
I get the warmest feeling, so good I almost cry
I kiss your sleeping lips and say I'll love you 'till I die
Oh girl of mine you make my day
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me
Our love will always be
So girl of mine turn out the light
And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight
Down life's golden road and you'll always know
I love you ... girl of mine
Sometimes I know I hurt you when things ain't goin' right
I walk away and leave you to face the lonely night
I wouldn't blame you darlin' if you walked out on me
But I return to find you there still waiting patiently
Oh girl of mine you make my day
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me
Our love will always be
So girl of mine turn out the light
And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight
Down life's golden road and you'll always know
I love you ... girl of mine
Oh well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the Lord comes and calls
Calls me away, oh yes
Well, the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, the night is as black
As the sea, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me
Well, the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed
From this creature that I am, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me
She'll tell you that she loves you, make you feel just like a kid
She'll cry to you and lie to you, she'll do 'most anything
She'll get right up next to you and the first thing that you know
You'll be telling her you're sorry because she hurt you so
I said she's evil the most evil girl I've found
There ain't no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town
She'll invite you over to her house at half past nine
You'll wear a suit, you'll wear a tie and you'll give your shoes a shine
You'll take a real deep breath and knock on her front door
Her little sister will tell you "She don't live here anymore"
I said she's evil the most evil girl I've found
There ain't no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town
And there ain't no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town
She'll put her arms around you and squeeze with all her might
She'll breathe a sigh and pucker her lips and pull your arms real tight
Your heart will pound like thunder, you'll melt in her embrace
But when you go to kiss her well she'll laugh right in your face
Because she's evil the most evil girl I've found
There ain't no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town
As the snow flies on a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born in the ghetto
And his mama cries 'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto
People, don't you understand the child needs a helping hand?
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me, are we too blind to see?
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way?
Well the world turns and a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows in the ghetto
And his hunger burns, so he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto
Then one night in desperation a young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car, tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto
As her young man dies on a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born in the ghetto
And his mama cries
(words & music red west)
It's no fun being lonely
...
Morning must come
Knowing, knowing there's no one for me
.....
Knowing, knowing there's no one waiting for me
Living below in this old sinful world
Hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptation sore
Where could I go but to the Lord?
Where could I go oh where could I go
Seeking the refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to save me in the end
Where could I go but to the Lord
Life here is grand with friends I love so dear
Comfort I get from God's own word
Yet when I face that chilling hand of death
Won't you tell me
Where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go oh where could I go
Seeking the refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to save me in the end
Won't you tell me
Where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go but to the Lord
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And I'm waiting just for you
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And in dreams your face I see
Well you're the guiding light that brightens up the night
And I see your face in my dreams
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And I'm waiting just for you
You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake- sugar, 
But you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh
No-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue,
Stick because I'm
Stuck on you
Gonna run my fingers thru your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Uh-uh-uh,
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch ya and the kissin' starts
A team o' wild horses couldn't tear us apart
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh,uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
I just got your letter baby
Too bad you can't come home
Well I swear I'm goin' crazy
Sittin' here all alone
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
I ain't slept a week since Sunday
I can't eat a thing all day
Every day is just blue Monday
Since you went away
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
Whoops there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace
I gotta get myself together
Before I lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train goin'
And leave my blues behind
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
Whoops there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace
I gotta get myself together
Before I lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train goin'
And leave my blues behind
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
Since your gone
I got a mess of blues
Yes my baby left me, never said a word
Was it something I done, something that she heard?

You know I lost my little darling
The night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
I remember the night of the Tennessee Waltz
Only you know how much I have lost
I know I lost my little darling
The night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
Well, I remember the night of the Tennessee Waltz
Only you know how much I have lost
I said [Inaudible]
My warped and worried mind resortd
To wandering off to ponder things I never talk about
A pretty girl I used to know but wouldn't know if we met face to face
And defying every logic known
I wish all the time machine could take me back again
To the wonder of my first love, the old folks tease me 'bout
Referring to her only as my little friend
Somewhere far away and maybe not so far away
The child has grown into a woman of the world
I assume just knowing that she knew so much of life at such a tender age
I learned from her the whispered things the big boys at the pool hall talk about
The thrill and disappointment, fear and shame that first love brings
But oh, how I thought I loved my little friend
The fragrance of the green grass mingled with the scent of love and warming earth
The moonlight night I kissed and cried and swore I'd never touch another girl
But time moved fast and I moved on and I loved others time and time again
But with each time I thought of her and always gave a little more
Assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
Oh-oh-oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
Oh-oh-oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
Oh-oh-oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
Your lips were made for kisses so tender
I'm almost in love tonight
When we are close, my heart says surrender
I'm almost in love tonight
And here under the spell of evening
I long to hold you tight
Heaven is near, why think of tomorrow
I'm almost in love tonight
It may be just the spell of evening
I long to hold you tight
Heaven is near, why think of tomorrow
I'm almost in love tonight
Almost in love
I went and bought myself a ticket
And I sat down in the very first row
They pulled the curtain
But then when they turned the spotlight way down low
Little Egypt came out a-struttin'
Wearin' nothin' but a button and a bow
Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
Ying-ying, ying-ying
She had a ruby on her tummy
And a diamond big as Texas on her toe
She let her hair down
And she did the hoochie-coochie real slow
When she did her special number on the zebra skin
I thought she'd stop the show
Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
Ying-ying, ying-ying
She did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Said, Phoenix, Arizona 1949
Yeah, but let me tell you people
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore
She's too busy mopping
And a-takin' care of shopping at the store
'Cause we've got seven kids
And all day long they crawl around the floor
Singing ying-ying, ying-ying
Ying-ying, ying-ying
Some people think that pot of gold
Is all they ever want to hold
But there's a treasure, I think more of
Measure for measure .. I'll take love
Some people think that their success
Is all they need for happiness
But there's a pleasure, I think more of
Measure for measure .. I'll take love
Pound for pound oh yeah and
Ounce for ounce love is all that really counts
So let them have their wealth and fame
Eat caviar and drink champagne
You're all the treasure I'm dreaming of
Measure for measure .. I'll take love
Pound for pound oh yeah and
Ounce for ounce love is all that really counts
So let them have their wealth and fame
Eat caviar and drink champagne
You're all the treasure I'm dreaming of
Measure for measure .. I'll take love
I'll take love, I'll take love
I'll take love, I'll take love
I awakened this morning, I was filled with despair
All my dreams turned to ashes and gone, oh yeah
As I looked at my life it was barren and bare
Without love I've had nothing at all
Without love I've had nothing
Without love I've had nothing at all
I have conquered the world
All but one thing did I have
Without love I've had nothing at all
Once I had a sweetheart who loved only me
There was nothing, oh that she would not give, oh no
But I was blind to her goodness and I could not see
That a heart without love cannot live
Without love I've had nothing
Without love I've had nothing at all
I have conquered the world
All but one thing did I have
Without love I've had nothing at all

Look at you and tell myself
How wonderful you are
You're so different now
To me you're much more wonderful, more wonderful by far
Yes, you're different now
There's more to love than holding hands and stealing kisses
No-one else around
There's the good times and the bad
There's the ups and downs we've had
But it's different now I'm so glad I still have you
There's always something new to see
I look at you, you look at me
And we're so different now
Love gets better every day 'n in some peculiar way
It's always different now
If we ever say goodbye, you'd be lost
And so would I, what's the difference now between us
Love just for a day, and a love that's here to stay
That's the difference now, the difference now
You don't like crazy music
You don't like rockin' bands
You just wanna go to a movie show
And sit there holdin' hands
You're so square, baby, I don't care
You don't like hotrod racin'
Or drivin' late at night
You just wanna park where it's nice and dark
You just wanna hold me tight
You're so square, baby, I don't care
You don't know any dance steps that are new
No one else could love me like you do, do, do, do
I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square, baby, I don't care
Baby, I don't care, baby, I don't care
Baby, I don't care
I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square, baby, I don't care
Baby, I don't care, baby, I don't care
Care, care, I don't care, care, care
Fool, fool, fool
That I was to fall for you
Well fool, fool, fool
That I was to fall for you
Well, I know what a fool I was
To think that you could love me too
Well, well, when I first met you baby
Well, I knew I couldn't win
But I just kept right on trying
'Cause trying is no sin
What a fool, fool, fool
That I was to fall for you
Well I know what a fool I was
To think that you could love me too
Well when I first met you baby

Come here my serenade, my desert serenade
A lover's melody, to bring you close to me
It's a tender lullaby, born of golden sand and sky
The song is new, and it's calling you
Tonight beside the desert palms
Come let me take you in my arms
Come here my serenade, my desert serenade
Wherever lovers dwell, it weaves it's magic spell
Soon a thousand dreams will start,
And romance will fill your heart
My lips conceal, love that's warm and real
Give me a chance to hold you near
You'll see a brand new world appear
So come and hear, my desert serenade, my desert serenade,
My desert serenade
(words & music by pomus - shuman)
It's a long lonely highway when you're travellin' all alone
And it's a mean old world when you got no-one to call your own
And you pass through towns too small to even have a name, oh yes
But you gotta keep on goin', on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin', though there's no-one to care
Just keep movin' down the line
It's a long lonely highway without her by my side
And it's a trail full of teardrops that keep on being cried
My heart's so heavy it's a low down dirty shame oh yes
You gotta keep on goin', on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin', though there's no-one to care
Just keep movin' down the line
I gotta rock for my pillow 'neath a weeping willow
And the cool grass for my bed
My drinking water's muddy so don't you tell me buddy
That I wouldn't be better off dead
It's a long lonely highway gettin' longer all the time
And if she don't come and get me
Well, I'm gonna lose my mind
So if you read about me tell her she's the one to blame, oh yes
You gotta keep on goin', on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin', though there's no-one to care
Just keep movin' down the line
Movin' down the line
Movin' down the line
I'll remember you
Long after this endless summer has gone
I'll be lonely oh so lonely
Living only to remember you
I'll remember too
Your voice as soft as the warm summer breeze
Your sweet laughter, mornings after
Ever after, I'll remember you
To your arms someday I'll return to stay
Till then I will remember too
Every bright start we made wishes upon
Love me always, promise always
Oooh, you'll remember too
I'll remember you

Come and lay down by my side

All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night

King Creole, go
There's a man in New Orleans who plays rock and roll
He's a guitar man with a great big soul
And he lays down a beat like a ton of coal
He goes by the name of King Creole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole, yeah
You know he's gone, gone, gone
And hip shaking King Creole
When the King starts to do it it's as good as done
He holds his guitar like a tommy gun
He starts to growl from way down his throat
He bends a string and that's all she wrote
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
And hip shaking King Creole
He sings a song about a crowded hole
He sings a song about a jelly roll
He sings a song about pork and greens
He sings some blues about New Orleans
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole, yeah
You know he's gone, gone, gone
And hip shaking King Creole
He plays something evil then he plays something sweet
No matter how he plays you got to get up on your feet
And when he gets the rockin' fever baby, heaven sakes
He don't stop playin' 'til his guitar breaks
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole, yeah
You know he's gone, gone, gone
And hip shaking King Creole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip shaking King Creole

Today I stumbled from my bed
With thunder crashing in my head
And my pillow still wet
From last night's tears
And as I think of giving up
A voice inside my coffee-cup
Kept crying out
Ringing in my ears
Don't cry, daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy, ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
Why are children always first
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
It's cruel, somehow
It just don't seem right
'Cause every time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so
I wonder will it be the same tonight
Don't cry, daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy, ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
Oh, daddy, please don't cry

Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me
Then I don't care
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Fools rush in
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know
When we met
I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in
And I don't care
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Fools rush in
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love

Night and you
And blue Hawaii
The night is heavenly
And you are heaven to me
Lovely you
And blue Hawaii
With all this loveliness
There should be love
Come with me
While the moon is on the sea,
The night is young
And so are we, so are we
Dreams come true 
In blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true
This magic night of nights with you
I'll pack up all my things and walk away
I don't want to hear another word you have to say
I've been waiting for so long
I just found out there's something wrong
And nothin' will get better if I stay
There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you, now I'm walking out the door
You used me, you deceived me
And you never seemed to need me
But I'll bet you won't forget me when I go
Seems I've been lost in a dream
Pretending that you care
And now I've opened up my eyes
And found it's all been just a great big fairytale
I've been lovin' you so long
I don't think I'd even know how to forget you
Yeah, the way that things have been
I think I'm better off alone
Than to be with you
There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you, now I'm walking out the door
You used me, you deceived me
And you never seemed to need me
But I'll bet you won't forget me when I go
Seems like I've been lost in a dream
Pretending that you care
Someday you'll open up your eyes
And realize a good man's hard to find
Seems like I've been lost in a dream
Pretending that you care
And now I've opened up my eyes
And realized a big fairytale
Gotta do some livin', got the wanderlust
Better clear the highway 'cause I'm gonna move some dust
Oh I got wheels, wheels on my heels
And I gotta keep rollin', rolling along
Lots of pretty dollies try to fence me in
But I love 'em and leave 'em 'cause a tumbleweed's my kin
Oh I got wheels, wheels on my heels
And I gotta keep rollin', rolling along
Why do I keep movin', never settlin' down
Can it be I'm looking for a dream I haven't found
Oh I got wheels, wheels on my heels
And I gotta keep rollin', rolling along
Oh I got wheels, wheels on my heels
And I gotta keep rollin', rolling along
I thank the Lord for everything
When things are going my way
He said to me I will comfort thee
And drive your cares away
He promised me I will walk thee
And drive your cares away 
I did not ask for riches
He gave me wealth untold
The moon, the stars, the sun the sky
(Are there for you) to behold
I thank the lord for everything
And I count my blessings each day
He came to me when I needed Him
I only have to pray
And He'll come to you if you ask Him to
He's only a prayer away
My wish came true 
When I met you 
I've searched and searched 
My whole life through 
There's just one thing 
Dear before we start 
Don't say you care
Then break my heart 
When you speak of love
Please be sincere
For if you play with love
It can bring tears my dear
My wish came true 
To my surprise
When you stood there before my eyes 
And when my heart
Started beating fast 
T'was then I knew 
I found true love at last
If I knew the way I'd go back home
The countryside has changed so much, I'd surely end up lost
Half-remembered names and faces so far in the past
On the other side of the bridges
That were burned once they were crossed
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When there's no one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here
Get back home where my childhood dreams and wishes
Still are none of my regrets
Go back to a place where I can figure all the odds
Have a fighting chance to lose the blues
And win my share of bets
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When there's no one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When there's no one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When there's no one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When there's no one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When he knows there's something missing
Tell me where, where will I go from here
Where will I go from here
O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exaltation
Oh sing all ye rivals
Of heaven above
Glory to God, Glory in the highest
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Some kids born with a silver spoon
I guess that I was born a little too soon
Hard knocks, all I ever knew was hard knocks
And I'm telling you, I said you'd better beware
'Cause I've had my share 
Some kids born as rich as a king
But I was born without a doggone thing
Hard knocks, all I ever knew was hard knocks
And I'm telling you, I said you'd better beware
'Cause I've had my share 
I walked a million miles I bet
Tired and hungry and cold and wet
I've heard that lonesome whistle blow
From New York City down to Mexico
Some kids born fancy free
Nobody never gave nothing to me but
Hard knocks, all I ever knew was hard knocks
And I'm telling you, I said you'd better beware
'Cause I've had my share 
I walked a million miles I bet
Tired and hungry and cold and wet
I've heard that lonesome whistle blow
From New York City down to Mexico
Some kids born fancy free
Nobody never gave nothing to me but
Hard knocks, all I ever knew was hard knocks
And I'm telling you, I said you'd better beware
'Cause I've had my share
I said you'd better beware
'Cause I've had my share
I said you'd better beware
'Cause I've had my share of hard knocks
Your the end of a rainbow
My pot of gold
Your daddys little girl
To have and hold 
A precious gem 
is what you are
Your mommys life and shining star
Your the spirit of christmas
My star on the tree
Your the easter bunny
To mommy and me
Your sugar your spice
Your everything nice
And your daddys little girl
Your the end of a rainbow
My pot of gold
Your daddys little girl
To have and hold 
A precious gem 
is what you are
Your mommys life and shining star
Your the spirit of christmas
My star on the tree
Your the easter bunny
To mommy and me
Your sugar your spice
Your everything nice
And your daddys little girl
The sandman comes to my house late each night
But it's way in the morning before he turns out my life
It's times like this my darling I can see
If I were you I'd know that I love me
The great snowman I've been called by all
But it looks like this time I'm gonna fall
It's times like this my darling I can see
Oooh If I were you I'd know that I love me
Wind and rain and storm closin' in on me
I've walked the streets alone with my self sympathy
Can you hear me saying hopefully
Oooh If I were you I'd know that I love me
Wind and rain and storm closin' in on me
I've walked the streets alone with my self sympathy
Can you hear me saying hopefully
If I were you I'd know that I love me
Oooh If I were you I'd know that I love me
If I were you I'd know that I love me
You may not mind that it's over
But I've a different point of view
Even though I am shattered
It's easy for you
You don't have to face the music
You don't have to face the crowd
Just go back where you came from
You ain't even proud
I had a wife and I had children
I threw them all away
And now you tell me, you dare to tell me
I should go back to them
What do you think I should say
I found it hard to leave them
Saddest thing I ever had to do
My problems haven't started
And it's easy for you
I had a wife and I had children
I threw them all away
And now you tell me, you dare to tell me
I should go back to them
What do you think, what on earth do you think I should say
If you ever tire of the good life
Call me in a year or two
I've got no choice, I'll forgive you
'Cause it's easy for you
You only have to call me, it's easy for you
You only have to call me, it's easy for you
Well, it's hard to be a gambler bettin' on the number
That changes ev'ry time
When you think you're gonna win, you think she's givin' in
A stranger's all you find
Yeah, that's hard to figure out, what she's all about
But she's a woman through and through
She's a complicated lady
So color my baby moody blue
Oh, moody blue
Tell me, am I gettin' through
I keep hangin' on
Trying to learn the song but I never do
Oh, moody blue
Tell me, who I'm talkin' to
You're like the night and day
And it's hard to say which one is you
Well, when Monday comes she's Tuesday
When Tuesday comes she's Wednesday, into another day again
Her personality unwinds just like a ball of twine
On a spool that never ends
Just when I think I know her well, her emotions reveal
She's not the person that I thought I knew
But she's a complicated lady
So color my baby moody blue
Oh, moody blue
Tell me, am I gettin' through
I keep hangin' on
Trying to learn the song but I never do
Hey, moody blue
Tell me, who I'm talkin' to
You're like the night and day
And it's hard to say which one is you
Oh, my baby, my moody blue
Oh, moody blue
Tell me, who I'm talkin' to
You're like the night and day
And it's hard to say which one is you
Yeah, moody blue
Tell me, am I gettin' through
I keep hangin' on
Trying to learn the song but I never do
Let me tell you about moody blue
Could I fall in love for the very first time
That's what I ask myself when you're lips touch mine
Could I fall in love on a night like tonight
That's what I'd like to know when I hold you tight
Now that we're alone (Now that we're alone)
Just a kiss apart (Just a kiss apart)
I have the answer from the feeling in my heart
Could I fall in love and forever be true
My heart tells me I could if I fell for you
Some guys fall in love with one girl, I gotta fall for two
There's just so much lovin' that one heart's supposed to do
So I go around with my heart draggin' on the ground
Doggin' me around, I'm the sorriest sight in town
I got double trouble, I got double trouble
I got double trouble twice as much as anybody else, oh yeah
I guess there's gotta be two dark clouds hangin' over me
My future looks a bumpy as a matchbox on the sea
Every time I think that I have finally got it made
Some losin' cards are played, I just can't make the grade
I got double trouble, I got double trouble
I got double trouble twice as much as anybody else, oh yeah
I got double trouble, I got double trouble
I got double trouble twice as much as anybody else, oh yeah
I had to leave town for a little while,
You said you'd be good while I'm gone,
But the look in your eye dun told me you told a lie,
I know there's been some carryin' on.
Baby, You're wearin' that loved on look, Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, You're wearin' that loved on look.
The ash trays are all full of ashes,
The floor needs a touch of the mop,
There's a man downstairs with a long bushy hair,
He said your party was a three day rock.
Baby, You're wearin' that loved on look, Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, You're wearin' that loved on look.
Baby if you ever loved me,
Then Bonnie and Clyde loved the law,
Well a bird can't fly and I don't like apple pie,
And trees won't grow in Arkansas.
Baby, You're wearin' that loved on look, Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
Baby, You're wearin' that loved on look.
I had to leave town for a little while,
You said you'd be good while I'm gone,
But the look in your eye dun told me you told a lie,
I know there's been some carryin' on.
Well - Baby, You're wearin' that loved on look,
Yeah - Baby, You're wearin' that loved on look
Yeah - Baby
Che bella cosa na jurnata 'e sole,
N'aria serena doppo na tempesta!
Pe' ll'aria fresca pare gina festa...
Che bella cosa na jurnata 'e sole.
Ma n'atu sole
Cchibello, oje ne'.
'o sole mio
Sta 'nfronte a te!
Quanno fa notte e 'o sole se ne scenne,
Me vene quase 'na malincunia;
Sotto 'a fenesta toia restarria
Quanno fa notte e 'o sole se ne scenne.
Ma n'atu sole
Cchibello, oje ne'.
'o sole mio
Sta 'nfronte a te!
You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
There's no tenderness like before in you fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it
But baby, baby I know it
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Oh, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone
There's no tenderness in your eyes when I reach out for you
Girl, you're starting to criticize every little thing that I do
It makes me just feel like crying
'Cause baby, something beautiful's dying
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Oh, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Baby, baby, I get down on my knees for you, this suit is won't too tight
If you would only love me, love me like you used to do
We had a love, love, love yo don't find every day
Oh, don't, don't, don't, don't take it away
Listen to me, talkin' to you
Bring back that lovin' feelin
Oh, that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feelin
Now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on
That lovin' feelin'
That, that lovin' feelin'
Softly and tenderly Jesus is callin'
Callin' for you and for me
Patient and loving He's waitin' and watchin'
Watchin' for you and for me
Well come home, well come home, home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, my Jesus is calling
Well oh sinner, sinner, come on home
Earnestly, tenderly, my Jesus is callin'
Callin' for you and for me
Patient and loving 'cos He's waitin' and watchin'
Watchin' for you and for me
Well I say come home, well come home
Well ye who are weary please come home, come home
Well, earnestly, tenderly, my Jesus is callin'
Callin' oh sinner, come home
Baby, you know me well
You know I mean what I say
Before I say farewell
I'll give you just another day
You'd better find out what's happening
Find out what's happening before long
If you don't find out what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone
Tell me what you're gonna do?
You'd better make up your mind
It all depends on you
I'm leaving you behind
You'd better find out what's happening
Find out what's happening before long, no, no
If you don't find out what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone, gone, yeah
Baby, you know it's true
We've been through thick and thin
But if you don't come through
You won't ever see me again
You'd better find out what's happening
Find out what's happening before long, oh Lord
If you don't find out what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone
You'd better find
(Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)
You better find out
  (Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)
You better find out
  (Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)
Oh Lord
  (Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)
If you don't, what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone
  (Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)
You'd better find
(Find out what's happening, find out what's happening)
You better find out
  (Find out what's happening)
Forever my darling
Our love will be true
Always and forever
I'll love only you
Just promise me darling
Your love in return
May this fire in my soul dear
Forever burn
My heart's at your command dear
To keep love and to hold
Making you happy is my desire dear
Keeping you is my goal
I'll forever love you
For the rest of my days
I'll never part from you
Or your loving ways
Just promise me darling
Your love in return
May this fire in my soul dear
Forever burn
My heart's at your command dear
To keep love and to hold
Making you happy's my desire dear
Loving you is my goal
I'll forever love you
For the rest of my days
I'll never part from you
Or your loving ways
Just promise me darling
Your love in return
May this fire in my soul dear
Forever burn
One, two, three, four
Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting for its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings a song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring
When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me, that's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life is the thing I can't win
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you
The breeze along the river seems to say
That she'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you
Yeah, if I could you know that I would fly away with you
Only you
Can do make all this world seem right,
Only you
Can do make the darkness bright,
Only you, and you alone
Can feel me like you do
And do fill my heart with love for only you.
Only you
Can do make all this change in me,
For it's true
You are my destiny.
When you hold my hand, I understand
The magic that you do,
You're my dream come true,
My one and only you.
Only you
Can do make all this change in me,
For it's true
You are my destiny.
When you hold my hand, I understand
The magic that you do,
You're my dream come true,
My one and only you.
Easy come, easy go
Here, there, everywhere
Crazy love is in the air
Nightfall, mmm, day and nightfall
So many girls in every port
You gotta be a juggernaut
Full speed ahead or you'll be caught
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Easy come, easy go
Up, down, all around, kiss and kiss
And pound for pound, delicious
Mmm, so nutritious
Sailor beware take it slow
Easy come, easy go, all right
When you want love to keep you warm
There's nothing like a uniform
You got a port in any storm
There she blows
Easy come, easy go
Up, down, all around, kiss and kiss
And pound for pound, delicious
Mmm, so nutritious
Sailor beware take it slow
Easy come, easy go
Sailor beware take it slow
Easy come, easy go
Easy come, easy go
Easy come, easy go
Easy come, easy go
Well, you're right, I'm left, she's gone.
You're right, and I'm left all alone.
Well, you tried to tell me so,
But how was I to know 
That she was not the one for me?
You told me all along,
You're right, our love was so wrong.
But now I changed my mind,
Because she broke the ties that bind, 
And I know that she never cared for me.
Well, I thought I knew just what she'd do,
I guess I'm not so smart.
Oh, you tried to tell me along she'd only break my heart.
I'm left, you're right, she's gone.
You're right, and I'm left all alone.
Well, she's gone I know not where,
But now I just don't care.
For now I'm falling for you.
If you'll forgive me now,
I'll make it up somehow.
So happy we will be,
In a home just for three,
And I'll soon forget her,
Now I know.
Well, I thought I knew just what she'd do,
I guess I'm not so smart.
You tried to tell me all along,
She'd only break my heart.
Well, you're right, I'm left, she's gone.
You're right, and I'm left all alone.
Well, she's gone, I know not where,
But now I just don't care,
For now I've fallen for you.
Back porch preacher preaching at me
Acting like he wrote the golden rules
Shaking his fist and speeching at me
Shouting from his soap box like a fool
Come Sunday morning he's lying in bed
With his eye all red, with the wine in his head
Wishing he was dead when he oughta be 
Heading for Sunday school
Clean up your own backyard
Oh don't you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine
Drugstore cowboy criticizing
Acting like he's better than you and me
Standing on the sidewalk supervising
Telling everybody how they ought to be
Come closing time 'most every night
He locks up tight and out go the lights
And he ducks out of sight and he cheats on his wife
With his employee
Clean up your own backyard
Oh don't you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine
Armchair quarterback's always moanin'
Second guessing people all day long
Pushing, fooling and hanging on in
Always messing where they don't belong
When you get right down to the nitty-gritty
Isn't it a pity that in this big city 
Not a one a'little bitty man'll admit
He could have been a little bit wrong
Clean up your own backyard
Oh don't you hand me, don't you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine
I wanna soothe my my heart, I wanna ease my mind
I wanna move my shoes and see what I can find
I wanna stand up tall and open up my eyes
I wanna reach out my hand until I touch the skies
I was a poor lost lamb in a deep dark hole
But now I've found that light I'm gonna save my soul
I used to drink, I used to smoke
I used to smoke, drink and dance the hoochy-coo
I used to smoke and drink, smoke and drink and dance the hoochy-coo
Oh yeah and now I'm standing on this corner praying for me and you
I-I-I that's why I'm saved I'm saved
People let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
You know I'm saved I'm saved
Well I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm in that soul saving army beating on that big bass drum
I used to cuss, I used to fuss
I used to fuss, cuss, worry all night long
I used to cuss and fuss, cuss and fuss
Cuss and fuss and worry all night long
Well, now I'm standing on this corner, I know right from wrong
I-I-I that's why I'm saved I'm saved
People let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
You know I'm saved I'm saved
Well, I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm in that soul saving army beating on that big bass drum
I used to lie, I used to cheat
I used to lie, cheat, steal from people's feet
I used to lie and cheat, lie and cheat and steal from people's feet
Well, now I'm steppin' on to glory salvation in my beat
Because I'm saved, I'm saved
People let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
I am saved I'm saved
Well, I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm in that soul saving army beating on that big bass drum
I'm in that soul saving army beating on that big bass drum
Oh yeah, because I'm saved, I'm saved
People let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
You know I'm saved I'm saved
Well, I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm saved, I'm saved I'm saved
(Words & music by Jesse Stone)
You gave me love to enjoy
Like a bright shiny toy to a baby
No matter what you would do
I depended on you like a baby
One thing I know I love you
Yes I loved you like a baby
It was a fool that you took
And I think 'cause you look like a baby
To lover's ways I was blind
'Cause I just had a mind like a baby
You're just a flirt
And I had to be her guide like a baby
I need you so, I need you so
The day I found I am alive
Then I broke down and cried like a baby
Well it was then I could see
You were playing with me like a baby
Well you can bet that some day
I'll forget just like a baby
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
When my rainbow turns the clouds away
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay
When the memories that linger into my heart
Memories that make my heart go cold
However some day they gonna live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
When my rainbow turns the clouds away
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay
When the memories that linger in my heart
Memories they gonna make my heart grow cold
Well, you know some day they gonna live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
When my rainbow turns the clouds away
Well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay
Now that the truth is hard to face
I can't forget you once were mine
Someone else is in my place
Whenever we meet my heart beats out of time
Just a little bit of green
Clouds my eyes to what I've seen
Just a little bit of green
When I see you with someone new
And knowing that there's nothing I can do
Please don't try to tie me down
Those are the words you often say
I can't help seeing you around
You smile with surprise, I turn my eyes away
Just a little bit of green
Oh-oh-ho, clouds my eyes to what I've seen
Just a little bit of green
When I see you with someone new
And knowing that there's nothing I can do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just a little bit of green
Oh-oh-ho, clouds my eyes to what I've seen
Just a little bit of green
When I see you with someone new
And knowing that there's nothing I can do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just a little bit of green
If I had my life to live over
I know just what I'd like to be
A pampered pet of a rich brunette
Sitting on my mama's knee
Someone to love me, someone to care
Rubber duck dubble little fingers through my hair
I need a dog's life
What a life, that's good enough for me
That's good enough for me
If I had a bone to be picking
A picking chicken or a steak
Curled up there in an easy chair
Man, that won't be hard to take
I'll always be faithful that's what I'd be
Never bite a hand that feeds me, no siree
Just lead a dog's life
What a life, that's good enough for me
That's good enough for me
I'd find me a pink little poodle
And lose my noodle over her
I chase her 'round all over town
Just to ruffle up her fur
Nuzzle her muzzle, a hole in her paw
Greatest case of puppy lovin' you ever saw
It's called a dog's life
What a life, that's good enough for me
You heard me say it now
That's good enough for me
That's good enough for me
The way she walks,
The way she talks
How long can I pretend
Oh I can't help I'm in love 
With the girl of my best friend
Her lovely hair,
Her skin so fair
I could go on and never end
Oh, I can't help I'm in love
With the girl of my best friend
I want to tell her 
How I love her so
And hold her in my arms, but then
What if she got real mad and told him so
I could never face either one again
The way they kiss
Their happiness
Will my ache-in' ever end
Or will I always be in love
With the girl of my best friend?
Never end,
Will it ever end?
Please let it end
When I'm over you there'll be darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever shine again when I'm o-over you
When you're leavin' is over and there's not another tear to cry
In the silence of that last goodbye just remember, remember this
When I'm over you there'll be darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever shine again when I'm over, over you.
Ooh-ooh-ooh
When I'm over you there'll be darkness, darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever shine again when I'm over, over you.
When I'm over you there'll be darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever shine again when I'm over, over you.
When I'm over you there'll be darkness, darkness, darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever, ever shine again when I'm over you.

Keep your hands off of her
She don't belong to you
Keep your hands off of her
She don't belong to you
She's mine, o mine, no matter what I do
She's long, lean and lanky
Tadadadaadaaa
Hands off of her, she don't belong to you
She's mine, o mine, no matter what I do
Dominic, Dominic why are you stallin'
Don't you hear love callin' to you
Moo, moo, move your little foot do
Dominic, Dominic pick one of them ticker
There's acres and acres to choose
Oh, oh, only a fool would refuse
I, I, If I had your trouble
Life would be double good sweet
There'd be no grass growin' under my feet
Listen Dominic, Dominic when will you hunger
You ain't gettin' younger my friend
Love, love, love 'em all right to the end
I, I, I can't understand you, leavin' them beauties forlorn
It's time to take the old bull by the horn
Come on Dominic, Dominic, they're itchin' and twitchin'
Better start pickin' some woo
Moo, moo, move your little foot do!
Well I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it
They don't abuse it, never gonna lose
I can't refuse it
Well, I've never been to England
But I kinda like the Beatles
So I headed for Las Vegas
Only made it out to Needles
I got to feel it, must be near
Oh it feel so good, feel so good
Well I've never been to Heaven
But I've been to Oklahoma
Well, they tell me I was born there
But I really don't remember
In Oklahoma or Arizona
What does it matter
What does it matter
Well I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it
They don't abuse it, never gonna lose
I can't refuse it
Well, I've never been to Arizona
But I've been to Oklahoma
Well, they tell me I was born there
But I really don't remember
In Oklahoma or Arizona
What does it matter
What does it matter
In Oklahoma or Arizona
What does it matter
What does it matter
Still I recall all the good times together
The love we shared, the fun and the laughter
How I wish you could feel what my heart says tonight dear
I miss you and I wish you were here
Dreams that I had they lay broken in sorrow
The plans I made the hopes for tomorrow
If I could I would tell you I'm lonesome tonight dear
Oh I miss you and I wish you were here
All through the night I will see memories passing
The way you looked the sound of your laughing
How I long for the touch of your hand holding mine dear
Oh I miss you and I wish you were here
Lord, I miss you and I wish you were here
Hear that old train whistle
howling in the night
If that flyer's southbound
Everything will be all right
I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now,
I'm gonna get back home somehow
Don't nobody tell me
baby's been untrue
If she's been unfaithful
I don't know what I'll do
I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now
I'm gonna get back home somehow
Never thought that I could miss her so
I never thought I could , now I know
The sound of the old train whistle
Makes me want to cry
Reminds me of that lonely feeling
When I said goodbye
I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now
I'm gonna get back home somehow
Build it up, knock it down
Hold it square, roll it around
Throw it in the air, stick it in the ground
But it's too bad, I can't get mad
Cause I'm a roustabout
Tie it loose, make it tight
If it's wrong, do it right
Makes me kinda feel like I wanna fight
But it's too bad, I can't get mad
Cause I'm a roustabout
Orders all day and half the night, from the boss
That guys cousin don't wanna see one minute lost
Stack it up, in the rig
Better still, bring it here
Wanna take it out stick it in his ear
But it's too bad, I can't get mad
Cause I'm a roustabout
A handyman is all I am around this place
Every time I turn around he's right up in my face
Bring it in, drag it out
When I'm slow, boy he shouts
Gettin aweful tired runnin' in and out
But it's too bad, I can't get mad
Cause I'm a roustabout
An angel sent from above, is Mama 
And everyone fell in love, with Mama 
Mama's so sweet, Mama's so nice
If there is trouble take Mama's advice
There's no-one I hold so dear, as Mama 
I always want to be near...
Mama....

This is a wonderful day
It's as bright as a day's ever been
There is a big yellow sun looking down
On a wonderful scene
Up in the blue sky birds fly
And sing our cares away
And out of each throat each note
Greets a wonderful day
There is the sound of a symphony
Carried along on the breeze
Even the flowers are swaying in time
With the leaves on the trees
Heaven is found right here on the earth
It surrounds us in the wonderful things all around
In this wonderful wonderful
Wonderful wonderful world
This is a wonderful day
It's as bright as a day's ever been
There is a big yellow sun looking down
On a wonderful scene
Heaven is found right here on the earth
It surrounds us in the wonderful things all around
In this wonderful wonderful
Wonderful wonderful world
Wonderful world, this wonderful world
Wonderful world, this wonderful world
Wonderful world, this wonderful world
I will be home again
Don't worry, dear
I'll be home again
So won't you dry the tear
The promise in your eyes
Will see me through
There'll be brighter skies
When I come back to you
Aah sweetheart, the love you're giving
Thrills my hungry heart
You make my life worth the living
Although we are apart
I will be home again
We'll start anew
Darling, until then
Our dreams will have to do
Aah sweetheart, the love you're giving
Thrills my hungry heart
You make my life worth the living
Although we are apart
I will be home again
We'll start anew
Darling, until then
Our dreams will have to do
There's a long line of mourners driving down our little street
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see, oh, yeah
They're all of your rich friends who knew you in the city
And now they've finally brought, brought you home to me
When you left you know you told me that some day you'd be returnin'
In a fancy car all the town to see, oh, yeah
Well, now everyone is watching you, you finally had your dream
Yeah, and you're ridin' in a long black limousine
You know the papers told of how you lost your life, oh, yeah
The party, the party and the fatal crash that night
Well, the race upon the highway, oh, the curve you didn't see
When you're riding in that long black limousine
You're riding in that long black limousine
Through tear filled eyes I watch as you ride by, oh, yeah
A chauffeur, a chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
Well, I never, I never, never, never, oh, my heart, all my dreams
Yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine

I was born in Macon Georgia
They kept my daddy over in Macon jail
He told me if you keep your hands clean
You won't hear them bloodhounds on your trail
Well I fell in with bad companions
Robbed a man, oh up in Tennessee
They caught me way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key
I washed my hands in muddy water
Washed my hands, but they didn't come clean
Tried to do what my daddy told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream
Well I asked the judge now when's my time up
He said son, oh you know we won't forget
If you try just to keep your hands clean
We might just make a good man of you yet
Oh I couldn't wait to get my time up
I broke out, broke out of Nashville jail
I just crossed the state-line of Georgia
Well I can hear those bloodhounds on my trail
I washed my hands in muddy water
Washed my hands, but they didn't come clean
Tried to do what my daddy told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream
Well there's a leak in this old building
Yes, there's a leak in this old building
Well there's a leak in this old building
We're gonna move to a better home
We got no pane in this old window'
We got no pane in this old window'
We got no pane in this old window'
We're gonna move to a better home
Well there's a hole in the roof where the rain pours in
A hole in the floor where it drops right out again
Well there's a leak in this old building
Well there's a leak in this old building
Well there's a leak in this old building
We're gonna move to a better home
Well there's a crack across the ceiling
Yes there's a crack across the ceiling
Well there's a crack across the ceiling
We're gonna find us a better home
We've gotta stove without a chimney
We've gotta stove without a chimney
What good's a stove without a chimney
We're gonna move to a better home
Pulling down window shades is no use at all
The kids and the neighbor can peep right through the wall
Well there's a leak in this old building
Well there's a leak in this old building
Well there's a leak in this old building
We're gonna move to a better, move to a better
Move to a better home
Oh, mama liked the roses, she grew them in the yard
But winter always came around and made the growing way too hard
Oh, mama liked the roses and when she had the time
She'd decorate the living room, for all us kids to see
When I hear the Sunday bells ringing in the morning
I remember crying when she used to sing
Oh, mama liked the roses but most of all she cared
About the way we learned to live and if we said our prayers
You know I kept the family Bible
With a rose that she saved inside
It was pressed between the pages
Like it had found a place to hide
Oh, mama liked the roses in such a special way
We bring them every mother's day and put them on her grave
Oh, mama liked the roses, mmm
Mama liked the roses, mmm, oh, mama liked the roses, mmm
(words & music: bob wills)
... remember alone in my heart
Call back my love of san antonio
Just pretend like tales fall apart
Think once again of my love, my own
A few words not known .... my heart I belong...
I don't know... of my rose in san antonio
Growing all this tender lala heart
Call back my love in san antonio
It's so sweet and tender like peddles fall apart....
Rose in san antonio... know my rose in san antonio
(note: sorry... but I couldn't make more of it)
(words & music by Don Robertson)
All the words that I let her know
Still could not say
How much I need you so in every way
I hope you will guide me
As only you can do
Hold my hands down beside me
I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you dear
From the dawn of each day
To always come through dear
In your kind lovin' way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel things you do
Then you know how completely
I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you dear
Around the dawn of each day
To always come true, dear
In your kind lovin' way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel things you do
Then you know how completely
I'm counting on you
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, man have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely man have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa
Or is it your way to hide a broken heart
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa
Or is it your way to hide a broken heart
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art
There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared that went unshared
Until it died within his silence
And Solitaire is the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing Solitaire
And keeping to himself begins to deal
And still the King of Hearts is well concealed
Another losing game comes to an end
And deals them out again
A little hope goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
There was a man, a lonely man
Who would command the hand he's playing
And Solitaire is the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing Solitaire
And keeping to himself, begins to deal
And still the King of Hearts is well concealed
Another losing game comes to an end
And deals them out again
And Solitaire is the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
Life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing Solitaire
(words & music by sid tepper - roy c. bennett)
When you meet by chance, it's not by chance
It's kismet
When two hearts stand still, it's destiny's will
It's kismet
The wheel of fortune spins, round and around it goes
Who will the arrow point to, only kismet knows
Until you came by, kismet and i, were strangers
But now that you're here, it's suddenly clear we've met
This is my lucky day, love's in the cards I'd say
Thanks to kismet, kismet, kismet
Until you came by, kismet and I were strangers
But now that you're here, it's suddenly clear we've met
This is my lucky day, love's in the cards I'd say
Thanks to kismet, kismet, kismet
Well, I quit my job down at the car wash
I left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
And for the next three weeks , I went huntin' them nights
Just lookin' for a place to play
Well, I thought my pickin'  would set 'em on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man
Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
So, I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar
Makin' music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son
So, I slept in the hobo jungles
I roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jammin'
So, I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man, show 'em, son
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band?
Wouldn't ya know
It's that swingin' little guitar man
Yeah, yeah
Take good care of her, take good care of her
I suppose I ought to say congratulations
For you won the only girl I ever loved
But I hurt too much to face the situation
Just take good care of her, take good care of her
Just to be around her was my greatest pleasure
She was everything my future held in store
So remember when you take my only treasure
Just take good care of her, take good care of her
I must accept it, she loves you more than me
So with my broken heart I'll bow out gracefully
Please don't send me any wedding invitation
For I couldn't bear to see her there with you
If she's happy, that will be my consolation
Just take good care of her, take good care of her
Take good care of her, take good care of her
Step in these arms, where you belong
It feels so right, so right
How can it be wrong?
There's something in the way you kiss
That makes me want to hold you tight
I know that nothing can't be wrong
That feels so right
Each time we kiss, you thrill me so
It means so much, so much
I can't let you go, boy
This isn't only for tonight
We're gonna love our whole life long
'Cause baby, if it feels so right
How can it be wrong?
This isn't only for tonight
We're gonna love our whole life long
'Cause baby, if it feels so right
How can it be wrong?
Don't forbid me to hold you tight
Darling, don't forbid me to hold you tight
Take me in your lovin' arms
Oh it's cold and I can keep you warm
Don't forbid me to talk sweet nothings
Don't forbid me to talk sweet talk
Take me in your arms baby please
Oh it's cold, it's cold and your lips might freeze
Don't forbid
Summer kisses, winter tears
That was what she gave to me
Never thought I'd travel all alone
The trail of memories
Happy hours, lonely years
But I guess I can't complain
For I still recall the summer sun
Through all the winter rain
The fire of love, the fire of love
Can burn from afar
And nothing can light the dark of the night
Like a falling star
Summer kisses, winter tears
Like the stars they fade away
Leaving me to spend my lonely nights
With dreams of yesterday
The fire of love, the fire of love
Can burn from afar
And nothing can light the dark of the night
Like a falling star
Summer kisses, winter tears
Like the stars they fade away
Leaving me to spend my lonely nights
With dreams of yesterday
Leaving me to spend my lonely nights
With dreams of yesterday
Summer kisses, winter tears
Well I know, if I'd arrived in time to know you
You'd have taken the time to show me
I wouldn't be lonely
Where will I go, who will I have to lie beside me
Is it something that's inside me
I'm so lonely
Tried so hard each time, each time I just can't make it
Feelin' fast vibrations and I just can't take it
Living from day to day, chasing the dream
I'm, I'm leavin
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tried so hard each time, each time I just can't make it
Feelin' fast vibrations and I just can't take it
Living from day to day, chasing the dream
I'm, I'm leavin
I know I'd go from rags to riches
If you would only say you cared
And though my pockets may be empty
I'd be a millionaire
My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything
So open your arms and you'll open the door
To all the treasure that I'm living for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore
Must I forever stay a beggar
Whose golden dreams will not come true
Or will I go from rags to riches
My fate is up to you

I saw three shrimp in the water, two were old and gray
I swam a little bit closer and .. I heard the third one say
Goodbye mama shrimp, papa shake my hand
Here come the shrimper for to take me to Louisian'
Here come the shrimper for to take me to Louisian'
He showed his mama and papa, the shrimp newspaper he read
An invitation to all the shrimp and this is what it said
Free ride, New Orleans, stay in grand hotel
Big Creole gal who help you come out of your shell
Big Creole gal who help you come out of your shell
If I should live to be ninety, I will never forget
The little shrimp and the song he sang as he jumped into the net
Goodbye mama shrimp, papa shake my hand
Here come the shrimper for to take me to Louisian'
Here come the shrimper for to take me to Louisian'
I see my light, I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
You look like an angel
Walk like an angel
Talk like an angel
But I got wise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh yes you are
The devil in disguise
You fool me with your kisses
You cheated and you schemed
Heaven knows how you lied to me
You're not the way you seem
You look like an angel
Walk like an angel
Talk like an angel
But I got wise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh yes you are
The devil in disguise
I thought that I was in heaven
But I was sure surprised
Heaven help me, I didn't see
The devil in your eyes
You look like an angel
Walk like an angel
Talk like an angel
But I got wise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh yes you are
The devil in disguise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh yes you are
The devil in disguise
Oh yes you are
The devil in disguise
All the rides are over and done
It's late and no prizes are left to be won
The rides are closed, it's the end of the day
The horses are moving away
Yes the fair's moving on
And I'll soon be gone
Remember the love that we've known
Yes the fair's moving on
But I won't leave you long
It's the last time you'll be on your own
The music has ended, the carousel's still
The horses in boxes with the big Ferris wheel
The canvass and glitter are safely on board
The trailers will soon hit the road
Yes the fair's moving on
And I'll soon be gone
Remember the love that we had
Yes the fair's moving on
But I won't leave you long
I'm coming back so please don't be sad
At dawn I'll be gone but I'll soon return
Till then the fair's moving on 
Till then the fair's moving on 
Till then the fair's moving on 
Till then the fair's moving on

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now, it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I don't have the laugh, I used to weep
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday, came suddenly
Why'd she have to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now, I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine

When I'm with my baby
Well, it ain't no fun with the sun around
I get going when the sun goes down
And I'm with my baby
Well, that's when we're gonna kiss
And kiss and kiss and kiss
And we're gonna kiss some more
Who cares how many times we kiss
'Cause at a time like this
Who keeps score?
Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I meet my baby
And it don't matter if it's sleet or snow
The drive-in's cozy when the lights are low
And I'm with my baby
Makes no difference, if the rain comes down
I don't notice when she's around
Oh boy, what a baby
Well, that's when we're gonna kiss and kiss
And kiss and kiss
And we're gonna kiss some more
Well, one kiss from my baby doll
Makes me hot
More, more, more, more
Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I'm with my baby
Well, that's when we're gonna kiss and kiss
And kiss and kiss
And we're gonna kiss some more
Well, one kiss from my baby doll
Makes me hot
More, more, more, more
Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I'm with my baby
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm lone
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand, precious Lord
Lead me home
When my way grows drear
Precious Lord, linger near
When my light is almost gone
Hear my cry, hear my call
Hold my hand, lest I fall
Take my hand precious Lord
Lead me home
When the darkness appears
And the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river, I stand
Guide my feet, hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord
Lead me home
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm lone
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord
Lead me home

I'm like a stranger
Like a stranger in my own home town
I'm like a stranger
Like a stranger in my own home town
My so called friends stopped being friendly
Oh but you can't keep a good man down
Oh no, can't get him down
I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago
I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago
But my home town won't accept me
Just don't feel welcome here no more
My home town won't accept me
Just don't feel welcome here no more
I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago, yes I did
I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago
But my home town won't accept me
Just don't feel welcome here no more
I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
Yeah, I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
My so called friends stopped being friendly
Oh but you can't keep a good man down
I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago, yes I did
I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago
My so called friends stopped being friendly
Oh but you can't keep a good man down
I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
My so called friends stopped being friendly
Oh but you can't keep a good man down
I just thought I heard a small voice crying
Looked again and saw that it was me
I feel like a little boy denying
That he fears the night 'cause he can't see
Then a larger thought said stop your crying
Don't be scared to search 'cause you may find
Fate holds out a candle for your footsteps
Time rolls back the shadows of your mind
It's a long, long lonely night
You can make the morning if you try
It's a long, long lonely night
Oh, we can make the morning if we try
Girl, we can make the morning you and I
Together, together, together 
Loneliness is darkness' first companion
Spend the night alone and faith may bend
Share it all and see how fear starts fading
Chase away the shadows with a friend
Dawn's elusive light is just beginning
Now the day can push away the night
Dreams can make the sun feel much brighter
Hope creates a foothold for the light
It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try
It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try
Girl, we can make the morning you and I, Oh
Together 
It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try 
It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try 
It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try
If today was not endless highway
If tonight was not endless trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all
Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
Only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again
I can't see my reflection in the water
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I can't remember the sound of my own name
Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again
There's beauty in the silver singing river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else could match the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes
Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again
If today was not an endless highway
If tonight was not endless trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all
Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again
We had a real good evening
Now all our friends are leaving
Soon we'll be alone
Wait till everybody has gone
Then play just one more song
'Cause this is our dance
Darling remember, it's our dance
Loving and tender
I'll take you away, take you away
In my arms
Yes this is our dance, now we're together
For our dance can't last forever
And nobody knows just what tomorrow will bring
So let our dance begin
We'll turn the light down low now
I'll never let you go now
You're here in my arms
And when I hear you whisper you're mine
We'll play that song just one more time
'Cause this is our dance
Darling remember, it's our dance
Loving and tender
I'll take you away, take you away
In my arms
Yes this is our dance, now we're together
For our dance can't last forever
And nobody knows just what tomorrow will bring
So let our dance begin
Hail to thee old ivy league
Poison ivy league
The ra-ra boys are sitting round the table tonight
The ra-ra boys have lots of plans in view
They're gonna have panty raids
And make their own lemonade
They'll live it up just like the big boys do
Poison ivy league, boys in that ivy league
Give me an itch, those sons of the rich
That poison ivy league
The ra-ra boys will go to bed so early tonight
Before exams they need a lot of rest
They gotta make good for dad
They gotta make good so bad
They'll even pay someone to take that test
Poison ivy league, boys in that ivy league
How can they flunk, they're so full of bunk
That poison ivy league
The ra-ra boys are being groomed for business some day
For better things to college they were sent
And you can bet they'll be the head of the company
As long as dear old daddy's president
Poison ivy league, boys in that ivy league
So loaded with cash, they give me a rash
That poison ivy league
So let it be told
I won't touch them with a ten foot pole
That poison Ivy league
This is my heaven
Being here with you
Make it last forever
This is my heaven
It's a dream come true
Make it last forever
Come to me now
And take my hand
This is the paradise I plan
You're like an angel
Sent from up above
Let's stay close together
You brought me heaven
When I shared your love
Make it last forever
Here 'neath the sky beside the sea
This is my heaven
When you come to me

There are lots of girls in the mountains
And they're worth their weight in gold
When they're in my arms with their lovin' charms
A treasure chest I hold
Well there's gold in the mountains, love in the hills
I don't need no city women with their diamonds and frills
There's gold in the mountains and oh what scenery
The prettiest girls I ever did see
There's such beauty there in the mountains
You can feel your knees growin' weak
Every single boy feels the height of joy
When he climbs that mountain peak
Well there's gold in the mountains, love in the hills
I don't need no city women with their diamonds and frills
There's gold in the mountains and oh what scenery
The prettiest girls I ever did see
I said there's gold in the mountains, love in the hills
I don't need no city women with their diamonds and frills
There's gold in the mountains and oh what scenery
The prettiest girls I ever did see
I ever did see
I ever did see

The girl I never loved
Will never know I cared
And all my dreams of her
Are dreams Ill never share
For I want her and I need her
And I know it might have been
But it ended long before it could begin
The kiss I never got
Somebody else will take
The plans I never made
Somebody else will make
Oh Im lonely, Im so lonely
cause its her Im thinking of
But shell always be the girl I never loved
Never loved, never loved 
 
Won't you show me how to kiss
Put your lips on mine
Do you do it just like this
Tell me I'm doing fine
We got a good thing going now take your time
Come on and make it last. 
Love may be new to you but Oooh, I'm catchin' on fast
Give, give, gimme all you've got to give
Love, love, love every moment you live
Now you've taught me all you know
Have I passed the test
Show me all you've got to show
Baby you're the best
But tell me I've learned quickly and I know each trick
I'm sure love's gonna last
Love maybe new to you but Oooh I'm catchin' on fast
Girls in kimonos, shy little flowers
Smiling from beneath their parasols
Dainty little moonbeams, delicate as China
Gentle little oriental dolls
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I make you feel second best
Girl, I'm so sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied, satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
(You are always on my mind)
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Oh, the way I feel tonight
You better wrap me up good and tight
In your arms
In your arms
Just like a bee in a honeycomb
I'm gonna make myself right at home
In your arms
In your arms
Well, it don't take much to keep me satisfied
Just a little bit of lovin' that's bonafide
In your arms keep me tangled up all the time
Like a kitten with a ball of twine
Yeah baby, that's where I want to stay
For the rest of my natural days
In your arms
In your arms
That's what you get for loving me
That's what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone, you can see
That's what you get for loving me
Now don't you shed a tear for me
I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I've had a hundred just like you
But don't be blue I'll have a thousand before I'm through
That's what you get for loving me
That's what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone, you can see
That's what you get for loving me
Now there you go, you're cryin' again
You should have known how things would end
But then some day when your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass this way again
That's what you get for loving me
That's what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone, you can see
That's what you get for loving me
Suntanned, windblown
Honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par
Oh, how lucky we are
While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So, on and on it will always be
True love, true love
For you and I
Have a Guardian Angel on high with nothing to do
But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true, love forever true
Something old, the time goes buy
Something new, these tears I cry
Something borrowed were those lips my lips knew
And that's why I'm something blue
Something old, the vows we made
Something new, the price I paid
Something borrowed, love was tried but not true
Now my life is something blue
I guess that I had better smile
Walking behind you down the aisle
I feel I'm walking to my doom
I'm really not the best man in this room
Something old, the dreams we planned
Something new, his wedding band
Something borrowed was the heart I gave you
You returned it torn in two
Something old, the dreams we planned
Something new, his wedding band
Something borrowed was the heart I gave you
You returned it torn in two
And that's why,
And that's why I'm something blue
Don't want a four leaf clover
Don't want an old horse shoe
Want your kiss 'cause I just can't miss
With a good luck charm like you
Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm 
a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight
Don't want a silver dollar
Rabbit's foot on a string
The happiness in your warm caress
No rabbit's foot can bring
Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm 
a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight
If I found a lucky penny
I'd toss it across the bay
Your love is worth all the gold on earth
No wonder that I say
Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm 
a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight
One boy, two little girls
Three hearts yearning for love
Although it's hard to explain
I know it may sound insane
But this one boy loves two little girls
Folks say three is a crowd
To each boy, one girl's allowed
But right now I'm having such fun
I just can't give up either one
'Cos this one boy loves two little girls.
There will come a time, I'll have to settle down
But until that time I love two girls hanging around
Now one day I must decide which one I'll choose for my bride
But till we three must part
I've twice as much love in my heart
'Cos this one boy loves two little girls
Oh well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the Lord comes and calls
Calls me away, oh yes
Well, the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, the night is as black
As the sea, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me
Well, the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed
From this creature that I am, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me
I used to laugh when I should cry
I used to let these feelings pass me by
But now that I believe them
I got no-one to leave them to me
You see I traded love for what I thought must be free
So I confess my loneliness
And I guess I've lost the best of the year
That I have lost it through my fingers like a golden breath of air
If I cared I wouldn't be singing this love song of the year
I know the time cannot erase the days
Love is past and I've gone away
From now on I'll make it very clear
Cos' I don't want to write
Another love song of the year
It's a lonely song and not too clear
But to me it's very dear
I guess this song can only be
My feelings went out in the sea of love
To me this has got to be the love song of the year
I know the time cannot erase the days
Love is past and I've gone away
From now on I'll make it very clear
Cos' I don't want to write
Another love song of the year
I used to laugh I used to cry
I used to laugh, these feelings passed me by
From now on I'll make it very clear cos' I don't want to write
Another love song of the year
I need somebody to lean on
I need somebody to, to tell my troubles to
No use denying, I'm close to cryin'
But what good, tell me, what good would my crying do?
I need somebody to help me
Help me forget all those worries on my mind
And when I'm lonely, if someone would only
Want to be sweet and kind
I need somebody, won't that somebody
Please, please listen to my plea?
Need that somebody, won't that somebody
Come running to me?
I need somebody to lean on
I'm tired of being unhappy and so blue
If she came I would hold her
'Cause I need that shoulder to lean on, yes, I really do
I need somebody and maybe that somebody is you
I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in Heaven on high
I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in Heaven on high
This thing called love, I just can't handle it 
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it 
I ain't ready 
Crazy little thing called love 
This thing called love
It cries in a cradle all night 
It swings, it jives 
It shakes all over like a jellyfish 
I kinda like it 
Crazy little thing called love 
There goes my baby 
She knows how to rock and roll 
She drives me crazy 
She gives me hot and cold fever 
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat 
I gotta be cool, relax 
Get hip, get on my tracks 
Take a back seat, hitch-hike 
And take a long ride on my motor bike 
Until I'm ready 
Crazy little thing called love 
I gotta be cool relax 
Get hip and get on my tracks 
Take a back seat, hitch-hike 
And take a long ride on my motor bike 
Until I'm ready 
Crazy little thing called love 
This thing called love, I just can't handle it 
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it 
I ain't ready 
Crazy little thing called love 
Crazy little thing called love...

Let's snap our fingers clap our hands
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside, down by the riverside
Let's give 'em what the song demands
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
We'll hear them playing keep that beat
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside, down by the riverside
Let's get together what a treat
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
Strike up the band, start the parade 
Don't let that grand old rhythm fade 
Just play that drum, play that number 
When the saints come marchin' in
Shake tambourines, play that cornet 
Crank up that horn you won't forget
Your heart will hum to that number 
When the saints come marchin' in
The cymbals clang, just pound that beat 
Sounds like a hundred marching feet 
It's fun to join in that number 
When the saints come marchin' in
See banners wave, oh hear that ring
We all feel prouder than a king 
'Cause everyone, everyone loves that number 
When the saints come marchin' in
If you found someone new, who means more than me to you
I'd never stand in your way
If you feel we must part, don't let pity rule your heart
I'll never stand in your way
I love you much too much to ever lose you
But what is to be will be and I'll obey
I'll be blue when you go but I'll never let it show
I'd never stand in your way
I loved you much too much to ever lose you
But what is to be will be and I'll obey
I'll be blue when you go but I'll never let it show
I'd never stand in your way
Well hello there
My it's been a long long time
How am I doin'
Well I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now and it seems that
It was only yesterday
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away
How's your new love
I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him
That you'd love him till the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing
That you told me
Seems like just the other day
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away
I gotta go now
Guess I'll see you hanging 'round
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
But I remember what I told you
That in time, it's going to be okay
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away
Yeah, ain't it funny' how time slips right on, slips right on
Away, away, away
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me, she loves me
The lady loves me and it shows
In spite of the way she turns up her nose
I'm her ideal, her hearts desire
Under that ice she's burning like fire
She'd like to cuddle up to me
She's playing hard to get
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet
The gentleman has savoir-faire
As much as an elephant or a bear
I'd like to take him for a spin
Back to the zoo to visit his kin
He's got about as much appeal as a soggy cigarette
The lady loathes him but he doesn't know it yet
The lady's got a crush on me
The gentleman's crazy obviously
The lady's dying to be kissed
The gentleman needs a psychiatrist
I'd rather kiss a rattlesnake
Or play Russian roulette
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet
She's falling fast she's on the skids
Both of his heads are flipping their lids
Tonight she'll hold me in her arms
I'd rather be holding hydrogen bombs
Will someone tell this Romeo
I'm not his Juliet
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet
She wants me
Like poison ivy
Needs me
Like a hole in the head
Everyone can see she's got it bad
He's mad!
The gentleman is an egotist
I'm simply aware I'm hard to resist
He's one man I could learn to hate
How's about having dinner at eight
I'd rather dine with Frankenstein
In a moonlight tete-a-tete
The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet
Oh yes she loves me
Dig that shrinking violet
Oh she really loves me
Here's one gal you'll never get
She lo- lo- loves me
Would you like to make a bet
I said the lady loves me
The gentleman's all wet
I just can't help believing
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes
I just can't help believing
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her size
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
Oh, I just can't help believing
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
As my fingers fold around it like a glove
I just can't help believing
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining honey sweet with love
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
For more than just a day
Hawaiian sunset peeping from the sea
Smiles and says Aloha to his sweetheart Hawaii
The drowsy islands slumber one by one
Close their sleepy eyelids say goodnight to the sun
Then Hawaii like millions of times before
Blossoms in her lover's arms once more
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
So until tomorrow, sleep Hawaii sleep.
Hey everybody gather round
N' listen to that bongo sound
Grab the first one in your reach
Now we're going to shake the beach
Do the Clam, do the Clam
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand
Turn n' tease, hug n' squeeze
Dig right in n' do the Clam
You can get your heart to spin
On the outside looking in
Moon ain't gonna last all night
Well, let's work up an appetite
Do the Clam, do the Clam
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand
Turn n' tease, hug n' squeeze
Dig right in n' do the Clam
Everybody's got that beat
Well, listen to those happy feet
Ain't you glad that you found out
What the Clam is all about
Do the Clam, do the Clam
Oh and grab your barefoot baby by the hand
Turn n' tease, hug n' squeeze
Dig right in n' do the Clam
Do the Clam, do the Clam
Oh and grab your barefoot baby by the hand
Turn n' tease, hug n' squeeze
Dig right in n' do the Clam
Dig right in n' do the Clam
One good turn deserves another
Be my love, I'll be your lover
It's all part of nature's laws
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch yours.
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, Hmm
Joy they say is in the giving
Come on give, make life worth living
Your welfare is my concern
Do a favour for me, I'll do one in return
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, Hmm
Scratch me now a little lower
What a feeling do it slower
That's it, Hmm you're getting hot
Well I gotta admit, you just hit the spot
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, Hmm
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back

AllÃÂ¡ en el rancho grande
AllÃÂ¡ donde vÃÂ­vÃÂ­a
Habi'a una rancherita
Que alegre me decÃÂ­a
Que alegre me decÃÂ­a:
"te voy hacer unos calzones
Comos los que usa el ranchero
Los comenzo de lana
Y los acabo de hierro."
There in the great ranch
There where she used to live
There used to be a cowgirl
Who joyfully used to tell me
Who joyfully used to tell me
"i'm going to make some trousers
Like those which the cowboy wears
I'm starting them with wool
And I'm finishing them with iron."
Let's take the phone off the hook
Turn the lights way down low
Baby put down that book
Tell the maid to go
Do not disturb
Hang the sign on the door
Do not disturb
It's time to make love
And I can't wait anymore
I'll just pull down the blind
Now come over here
I've got one thing in mind
Let's get comfortable dear
Do not disturb
Hang the sign on the door
Do not disturb
It's time to make love
And I can't wait anymore
Everything's right tonight
Mmmm, it's great when we kiss
Now your arms hold me tight
Let's stay like this
We almost shared a dream
We almost made it as a team
How nice it would have been
We almost touched the stars
And there stood heaven, almost ours
But we were just outsiders looking in
We had the chance to fall
But fate stepped in to end it all
Before it could begin
And if it's true, you're really going
There's nothing but goodbye to say
The saddest part of all is knowing
We almost went all the way
Breeze, sing a happy song
This heart of mine is singing right along
Don't know where I'm going, don't know where it ends
Till the grass is greener, beyond the bend
I haven't got a care
I'm just on my way to anywhere
Pocketful of nothing, nothing I can spend
Hope the grass is greener, beyond the bend
Beyond the bend, perhaps there'll be
Somebody waiting who's right for me
So I got to move around
And I know I've got to cover ground
Oh, the trip is shorter when you got a friend
Gotta find that rainbow beyond the bend
Beyond the bend, perhaps there'll be
Somebody waiting who's right for me
So I got to move around
And I know I've got to cover ground
Oh, the trip is shorter when you got a friend
Gotta find that rainbow beyond the bend
Beyond the bend, beyond the bend
Is this train the Frankfort Special
Now ain't this outfit something special
Well, we heard rumors from the bases
Frankfort girls got pretty faces
Go, Special go. Blow whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go
Whao - oh - oh
Now when we get to our headquarters
We'll be good boys and follow orders
Now don't take girls from one another
No! No! No! No! No!
We'll treat a sailor like a brother
Go, Special go. Blow whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go
Whao - oh - oh
Round wheels singin' on a long flat track
Boiler bustin' to blow its stack
Towns and villages flyin' by
Farewell frauleins, don't you cry
You'll soon get another G.I.
Come on, train, and get the lead out
Well, one more day we gotta sweat out
Frantic frauleins at the station
They're ready for a celebration
Go, Special go. Blow whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go
Go, Special go. Blow whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go
Whao - oh - oh
Come on, train, and get the lead out
Well, one more day we gotta sweat out
Frantic frauleins at the station
They're ready for a celebration
Go, Special go. Blow whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go
Whao - oh - oh
Whao - oh 
Whao - oh, whao - oh, whao - oh, whao - oh, whao - oh,
Whao - oh, whao - oh, whao - oh
You're sleeping son, I know
But, really, this can't wait
I wanted to explain
Before it gets too late
For your mother and me
Love has finally died
This is no happy home
But God knows how I've tried
Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy
I know it's hard to understand
Why did we ever start?
We're more like strangers now
Each acting out apart
I have laughed, I have cried
I have lost every game
Taken all I can take
But I'll stay here just the same
Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy
Sleep on, you haven't heard a word
Perhaps it's just as well
Why spoil your little dreams
Why put you through the hell
Life is no fairytale
As one day you will know
But now you're just a child
I'll stay here and watch you grow
Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy
...
Well, I woke up this morning
And I looked out the door
I can tell that old milk cow
By the way she lowed
Hold it fellows, that don't move me
Let's get real, real gone for a change
Well, I woke up this morning
And I looked out the door
I can tell that, that old milk cow
I can tell the way she lowed
Well, if you've seen my milk cow
Please ride her on home
I ain't had no milk or butter
Since that cow's been gone
Well, I tried to treat you right
Day by day
Get out your little prayer book
Get down on your knees and pray
For you're gonna need
You're gonna need
Your loving daddy's help someday
Well, you're gonna be sorry
For treating me this way
Well, believe me, don't that sun
Look good going down?
Well, believe me, don't that sun
Look good going down?
But, don't that old moon look lonesome
When your baby's not around
Well, I tried everything to
Get along with you
I'm gonna tell you what I'm going do
I'm gonna quit my crying
I'm gonna leave you alone
If you don't believe I'm leaving
You can count the days I'm gone
I'm gonna leave
You're gonna need your
Loving daddy's help someday
Well, you're gonna be sorry
You treated me this way
Don't, don't, that's what you say
Each time that I hold you this way
When I feel like this and I want to kiss you
Baby, don't say don't
Don't, don't, don't leave my embrace
For here in my arms is your place
When the night grows cold and I want to hold you
Baby, don't say don't
If you think that this is just a game, I'm playing
If you think that I don't mean every word I'm saying
Don't, don't, don't feel that way
I'm your love and yours I will stay
This you can believe I will never leave you
Heaven knows I won't baby, don't say don't
Don't
Listen, to the wisdom of the ages
Listen, to the words of many sages
Live each day, as if it were your last
It's written in the stars, your destiny is cast
And that hourglass, runs too fast no doubt
For the sands of time are running out
Listen, to the wisdom of the ages
These words, can be found in history's pages
Live each day, for happiness can't wait
And love while you may, but heed the hand of fate
If the finger points, it's too late no doubt
For the sands of time, are running out
But the man who turns, and escapes somehow
Is the wisest of men
And to such a man, I'd bow

It was a night oo-oo what a night
It was it really was such a night
The moon was bright oh how so bright
It was it really was such a night
The night was alight with stars above
Oo-oo when she kissed me
I had to fall in love
Oh it was a kiss oo-oo what a kiss
It was it really was such a kiss
Oh how she could kiss oh what a kiss
It was it really was such a kiss
Just the thought of her lips
Sets me afire
I reminisce and I'm filled with desire
But I'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember, I'll always remember
Oh, what a night oo-oo what a night
It was it really was such a night
Came the dawn and my heart and her love
And the night was gone
But I'll never forget the kiss
The kiss in the moonlight
Oo-oo such a kiss, such a night
It was a night oo-oo what a night
It was it really was such a night
Came the dawn and my heart and her love
And the night was gone
But I'll never forget the kiss
The kiss in the moonlight
How well I remember, I'll always remember
That night oo-oo what a night
It was it really was such a night
When we kissed I had to fall in love
But I'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember, I'll always remember
Oh that night oo-oo what a night
It was it really was such a night
When we kissed I had to fall in love
Well she's gone, gone, gone
Yes she's gone, gone, gone
Came the dawn, dawn, dawn
And my love was gone
But before that dawn
Yes before that dawn and before that dawn
When you meet by chance, it's not by chance
It's kismet
When two hearts stand still, it's destiny's will
It's kismet
The wheel of fortune spins, round and around it goes
Who will the arrow point to, only kismet knows
Until you came by, kismet and I, were strangers
But now that you're here, it's suddenly clear we've met
This is my lucky day, love's in the cards I'd say
Thanks to kismet, kismet, kismet
Until you came by, kismet and I were strangers
But now that you're here, it's suddenly clear we've met
This is my lucky day, love's in the cards I'd say
Thanks to kismet, kismet, kismet
Why me Lord? What have I ever done
To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord what did I ever do to deserve loving You?
And the kindness, You've shown
Lord Heavenly Jesus, I'm wasted and
So help me Jesus, I know what I am
Now that I know that I needed You so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in Your hands
Try me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can ever repay, all I've taken from You
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to You
Lord Heavenly Jesus, I praise Him
So help me Jesus, I know what I am, oh yes
Now that I know that I needed You so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in Your hands
Jesus, my soul's in Your hands
Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help  falling in love with you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows shorely to the sea
Darling so it goes some things are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows shorely to the sea
Darling so it goes  some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with you
Drums of the islands you're beating in my heart
You're with me no matter where I roam
If ever I wander if ever we're apart
I know that you will lead me home
If I should journey across the deep blue sea
I'll never forget these coral shores
Drums of the islands I hear you calling me
And I'll return forever yours
I love each valley each grain of sand each hill
The flowers the music of the isles
These are the things I love and always will
Though I may roam ten thousand miles
When you say that's it boy
I'm finally beat
You're goin' ninety miles an hour
Down a dead end street
You don't want to fight no more
You think that you can't win
Come on boy take a real deep breath
Jump right in and 
Hold your head up high
Oh you gotta be strong
Come on and sing, sing, sing
There ain't nothing like a song
Now they may take away your job
Take your fancy car
They may repossess your clothes, take that fine guitar
They may take everything you own
Well that's just for today
As long as you've got a song in your heart
Tomorrow's gonna be O.K.
Hold your head up high
Oh you gotta be strong
Come on and sing, sing, sing
There ain't nothing like a song
All right
There ain't nothing gonna stop you
Once you've set your mind
The only people gonna knock you
Are jealous of what they find
Just keep a smile right on your face
Don't let 'em get you down
When you wake up tomorrow
The world is spinnin' round
Hold your head up high, hey, hey, hey
You gotta be strong, all right
Come on and sing, sing, sing
There ain't nothing like a song
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you, still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow to the sea
To the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers cry
"Wait for me, wait for me"
I'll be coming home wait for me
Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Just pretend that we're together all alone
Tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
You can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go
You can't say the words I want to hear
When you're with another man
If you love me, answer, yes or no
Darling, I will understand
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Just pretend we're together all alone
We'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
You can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go
You can't say the words I want to hear
When you're with another man
If you love me, answer, yes or no
Darling, I will understand
Just put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Just pretend that we're together all alone
We'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go
Yes, you can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go
Sul mare luccica
L'astro d'argento
Placida e' l'onda
Prospero e' il vento
Venite all'agile
Barchetta mia
Santa Lucia
Santa Lucia...
Fool, you didn't have to hurt her
Fool, you didn't have to lose her
Fool, you only had to love her
But now her love is gone
Fool, you could have made her want you
Fool, you could have made her love you
Fool, you only had to love her
But now her love is gone
Gone now the love and laughter
See yourself the morning after
Can't you see her eyes are misty
As she said goodbye
Fool, you didn't have to hurt her
Fool, you didn't have to lose her
Fool, you only had to love her
But now your love is gone
Fool, you only had to love her
But now love is gone
Fool, you could have made her want you
Fool, you could have made her love you
Fool, you only had to love her
But now her love is gone
Fool, you didn't have to hurt her
Fool, you didn't have to lose her
Fool, you only had to love her
I'll never let you go, little darlin'.
I'm so sorry 'cause I made you cry.
I'll never let you go, 'cause I love you.
So please don't ever say good-bye.
The stars would tumble down beside me,
The moon would hang its head and cry.
My arms would never hold another baby doll
If we should ever say good-bye.
Well, I'll never let you go, 
Because I love you, pretty baby.
I'm so sorry 'cause I made you cry.
I made you cry.
Yeah, I'll never let you go,
'Cause I love you, little baby.
So please don't ever say good-bye.
When I think of how He came so far from glory
Came to dwell among the lowly such as I
To suffer shame and such disgrace
On Mount Calvary take my place
Then I ask myself this question
Who am I?
Who am I that The King would bleed and die for
Who am I that He would pray not my will, Thy Lord
The answer I may never know
Why He ever loved me so
But to that old rugged cross He'd go
For who am I?
When I'm reminded of His words
I'll leave Him never
If you'll be true I'll give to you life forever
Oh I wonder what I could have done
To deserve God's only Son
To fight my battles until they're won
For who am I?
Who am I that The King would bleed and die for
Who am I that He would pray not my will, Thy Lord
The answer I may never know
Why He ever loved me so
But to that old rugged cross He'd go
For who am I?
But to an old rugged cross He'd go for, who am I?
(Ernest Tubb)
It's been so long darling since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long darling  but now I realise
And just 'cos by seeing you it hurts me through and through
It's been so long darling that I'm back to you
Baby it's wrong, wrong as can be
To try and tie guy like me
I could never settle down in a little sleepy town
There is so much world to see
Sure would be happy for a while
But then we'd have to part
When tears replace your loving smile
Well, I don't want to be the guy
Who has to break your heart
So, here's where it ends, not lovers but friends
Though your lips are tempting me
Maybe I'm a fool and yet
This wanderer just can't forget
There is so much world to see
Sure would be happy for a while
But then we'd have to part
When tears replace your loving smile
Well, I don't want to be the guy
Who has to break your heart
So, here's where it ends, not lovers but friends
Though your lips are tempting me
Maybe I'm a fool and yet
This wanderer just can't forget
There is so much world to see
For me, there's so much world to see
Yeah, yeah
Well it's so very hard to have
To leave the one you love
And you get more lonely
With each passing day
It's so lonely just sitting
And dreaming of
That girl thousand miles away
Yes, it's still lonely having
Just her picture here with me
And I know I just can't stand it anymore
I'm gonna leave right now 
and go back where I ought to be
Goin' home to the girl that I adore
Well it's so very hard to have
To leave the one you love
And you get more lonely
With each passing day
It's so lonely just sitting
And dreaming of
That girl thousand miles away
Well, every time I hear 
her sweet voice on the telephone
Then I know I just can't stand it another day
I'm gonna call right back
And tell her that I'm coming home and stay
Call her back and say I'm comin' home and stay
Call her back and say I'm comin' home and stay
There is no God, but God,
I know this is true
God made everything,
He made me, He made you
There'd be no birds,
No planes to sail in the blue
Without his wondrous eyes
To see them through
They say God made land
And He gave it all to man
Yes I know He's mighty good and true
There is no God, but God
And He knows everything to do
So just you call on Him
And He will share His love with you
There is no God, but God
I know this is true
For God made everything, 
He made me, He made you
There'd be no birds,
No planes to sail in the blue
Without his wondrous eyes
To see them through
They say God made land
And He gave it all to man
This I know is mighty, good and true
There is no God, but God
And He knows everything to do
So just you call on Him
And He will share His love with you
I don't want my heart to be broken
Cause it's the only one I've got
So darling please be careful
You know I care a lot
Darling please don't break my heart
I beg of you
I don't want no tears a-falling
You know I hate to cry
But that's what's bound to happen
I you only say goodbye
Darling please don't say goodbye
I beg of you
Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true
Make me know you'll love me
The same way I love you little girl
You got me at your mercy
Now that I'm in love with you
So please don't take advantage
Cause you know my love is true
Darling please please love me too
I beg of you
Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true
Make me know you'll love me
The same way I love you little girl
You got me at your mercy
Now that I'm in love with you
So please don't take advantage
Cause you know my love is true
Darling please please love me too
I beg of you
Our friends all ask me
The last time I saw you
And I smile and tell them
It's been a day or two
There's no way to explain it
The way that I miss you
And my love, you have left me
Indescribably blue
I talk to your picture
My fav'rite one of you
I wish that you were here with me
But what good will it do
Having no way to tell you
The pain that I've been through
Oh, my love, you have left me
Indescribably blue
Yes, my love, you have left me
Indescribably blue
I'm a poor Hawaiian beach boy
A long way from the beach
'Cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can
I was minding my own business
Just drinking daddy's juice
I swear I'll never touch that stuff again
Just like a pig before he gave his all that aluhau
I'm in the pen
Got those beach boy blues
Don't the time go slow
Lonely beach boy blues
Only 30 day's and 90 years to go
I want a taste of honey
From my wahini's lips
I want to be her ever loving man
But I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can
But I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can
So close, yet so far from paradise
I hold, you in my arms, in paradise
Is mine, then you slip away
Like a child at play, and here am I
So close, yet so far from paradise
When you, are close to me, it's paradise
We kiss, oh my love, paradise
Is mine, then suddenly you're gone from me
Like a floating star, I see, and here am I
So close, yet so far from paradise
I reach out for you, but each time I do
I always find you gone
I know love is new, I'll take care of you
In my arms is where you belong
Just, a step away, are we from paradise
Take my hand, come away, to paradise
My love, I want you close to me
I need you desperately, oh here am I
Waiting for you
Here am I
Praying for you
Here am I, so close, yet so far from paradise
Well Lord I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's growin' in the meadow (down by the water)
I shall not be moved
I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved
On my way to glory land I will not be moved
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved
Well I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved
On my way to glory land I shall not be moved
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved
Oh well
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved
How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
The girl I'm mad about is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel?
How do you think we stand?
Well, I know you've made your plans
But you've included three
And that's too much for me
How do you think I feel?
I won't be true again
I know that I can't win
So why should I pretend
That you still love me?
How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
The one I'm mad about is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel?
How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
The girl I'm mad about is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel?
Well, how do you think we stand?
I know you've made your plans
Another's pretty face
Has put me out of place
How do you think I feel?
I won't be true again
I know that I can't win
So why should I pretend
That you still love me?
How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
And you've included three
And that's too much for me
How do you think I feel?
She may say she needs fancy bangles and beads
That's part of a woman's plan
But what every woman lives for
What every woman lives for
Is to give her love to a man
Wise men have known women can't live alone
So a woman should understand
That what every woman lives for
What every woman lives for
Is to give her love to a man
He may not be the kind you find in picture books
A real life hero with dashing handsome looks
He may not be the guy that you've been dreaming of
But that won't stop you from giving him your love
So dear, can't you see that it was meant to be
It's part, part of our destiny
'Cause what every woman lives for
What every woman lives for
Is to give her love to a man
And I hope that man is me 
Just for old time sake
Won't you give my heart a break
Let's get together again
Let's relive the time
I was yours and you were mine
Life was so wonderful then
I know, I know the day I let you go
I made my greatest mistake
If you loved me then
You could love me once again
Won't you try just for old time sake
Bennie Benjamin, Sol Marcus
Anyone could fall in love with you
Anyone who knows you as I do
Anyone could fall in love with you
And I love you my darling
Anyone could lose his heart like me
Anyone who has eyes that can see
Anyone could fall in love like me
And I love you my darling
You're the star I reached for
You're a dream so rare
You're my greatest treasure
Nothing can compare
Anyone could want you for his own
Anyone not only mine alone
Anyone could fall in love with you
And I love you my darling
Anyone could fall in love with you
And I love you my darling
 
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You're gonna walk that floor the way that I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You're gonna walk that floor just the way that I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
(words & music by giant - baum - kaye)
I give, give you my heart
Today, tomorrow and forever
You'll always be my love
I vow we'll never part
Today, tomorrow and forever
Long as there's stars above
The cares of life will fade away
As long as we're together
So stay, stay in my arms
Today, tomorrow and forever
You'll always be my love
I give, give you my heart
Today, tomorrow and forever
You'll always be my love
The cares of life will fade away
As long as we're together
So stay, stay in my arms
Today, tomorrow and forever
You'll always be my love
You'll always be my love
You ask how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never I'll still be loving you
Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you 'till the blue bells forget to bloom 
I'll love you 'till the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you 'till the poets run out of rhyme
Oh, until the twelfth of never 
And that's a long long time
Until the twelfth of never 
And that's a long long time
I've been traveling over mountains
Even through the valleys, too
I've been traveling night and day
I've been running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you.
Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
I've been traveling night and day
I've been running all the way
baby, trying to get to you
When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us,
But they didn't mean a thing.
I just had to reach you, baby,
In spite of all that I've been through.
I kept traveling night and day,
I kept running all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.
Well if I had to do it over
That's exactly what I'd do,
I would travel night and day,
And I'd still run all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.
Well, there's nothing that could hold me
Or that could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true
Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through,
When my way was dark as night, 
He would shine His brightest light,
When I was trying to get to you.
If time were not a moving thing, I could make it stay
This hour of love we share would always be
There'd be no coming day to shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over
When you walk away from me there is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun that rises over the land
I watch you walk away come how I have to let you go
Now it's over
If you knew just how I really feel you might return and yet
There are so many times that people have to love and then forget
Oh there might have been a way somehow
I have to force myself to say, it's over
So I turn my back, turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence tying not to think at all
I set my feet before me walk the silent street before me
Now it's over
If time were not a moving thing and I could make you stay
This hour of love we share would always be
There'd be no coming day to shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over
It's over, oh
How would you like to be?
A little circus clown
And you could wear a smile
Instead of a frown
How would you like to be?
A little kangaroo
A-hoppin' up and down
And I could hop with you
Come on and smile a little, smile a little
hop a little, hop a little,
Smile a little, hop a little bit with me
Come on and smile a little, smile a little
hop a little, hop a little,
Smile a little, hop a little bit with me
How would you like to be?
A little buzzing bee
And instead of a tree
You could buzz around me
How would you like to be?
A little mocking bird
And you can sing me songs
Like I never heard
Come on and buzz a little, buzz a little
Sing a little, sing a little
Buzz a little, sing a little bit with me
Buzz, buzz, buzz a little
Do re mi a little
Buzz a little, sing a little bit with me
How would you like to be?
A little baby bear
And you can hug me tight
Any time you care
How would you like to be?
A little dancing doll
And you could dance with me
Everytime I call
Well children by and by when the morning comes
All the saints of God together they come
We will tell the story how the Lord will come
And we'll understand him better by and by
Trials dark on every hand and we cannot understand
All the ways God will lead us
To the blessed promised land
He will guide us with his eye
And we'll follow till we die
And we'll understand him better by and by
Well children by and by when the morning comes
All the saints of God together they come
We will tell the story how the Lord will come
And we'll understand him better by and by
Temptation's hidden snares often take the sun away
And our hearts are made to bleed
For some thoughtless word or deed
And we wonder why the test when we try to do our best
But we'll understand it better by and by
Well children by and by when the morning comes
All the saints of God together they come
We will tell the story how the Lord will come
And we'll understand him better by and by
And we'll understand him better by and by
As you travel along on the Jericho Road
I would take young Johnny Cash to do this
Does the road seem all long and heavy your load
Just take it to Christ your sins all confess
On the Jericho Road your heart He will bless
On the Jericho Road
The clock by the bed is ticking too loud in the quiet night
I lie in the darkness thinking I must go before it's light
Before you open up your eyes and you beg me to stay
I'll leave 'cause I can't stand to see you hurt this way
Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry
Though I knew the time was coming and our love would end somehow
I just couldn't bear to tell you exactly just when or how
I know we can't go on, that it was wrong to start
But if you wake up crying now, you know you'll break my heart
Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry
Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry
Ohhhh, Sleep my love as I kiss you, kiss you, kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry
Ohhhh, Sleep my love as I kiss you
Angel, with those angel eyes
Come and take this earth boy
Up to paradise
Angel, may I hold you tight?
Never kissed an angel
Let me kiss one tonight
If I said "I love you"
Would I be speaking out of turn?
I'm only human, but I'm willing to learn
Angel, make my wish come true
Let me be in heaven here on earth with you
Angel, never kissed an angel
Let me kiss one tonight
If I said "I love you"
Would I be speaking out of turn?
I'm only human, but I'm willing to learn
Angel, make my wish come true
Let me be in heaven here on earth with you
I am just a lonesome cowboy
And I'm travelling all alone
I ain't even got a nickel
To call my baby on the phone
Just beyond the mountain lies a city
And I hear it calling me
Saddle up and ride you lonesome cowboy
Here is where you'll find your destiny
In my dreams the lights shine bright and pretty
Near to me and yet so far
Will I always be a lonesome cowboy
Am I only reaching for a star
Ride. Ride, ride, ride along cowboy
Sing, sing, sing, sing a song cowboy
Will I ever leave this lonesome valley
Really see the lights that shine
Gotta find what lies beyond the mountain
Gotta rope and tie that dream of mine
I am just a lonesome cowboy
And I'm travelling all alone
If you don't call me baby
Then I'm never coming home
Instrumental
He's your uncle, not your dad
He's the best friend you ever had
So, come on, dig, dig, dig in until it hurts
Just remember Pearl Harbor
The Alamos and nothing could be worse
He's your favorite relative
And he needs a lot to live
So just bring, bring, bring everything until you bleed
And he'll send back what he don't need
If you're not in form, ten-forty's your salvation
By deprivation of temptation
Dark and blondes I hear are not deductible
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me?
When he calls you as he may do
Don't be frightened, red white and blue
Just be thankful you don't live in Leningrad
He's your uncle, not your dad
If you're honest, you don't have to shake and shiver
The food is lousy up the river
It's give and take and he does all the taking
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me?
Life has two things you can't subtract
Death and taxes to be exact
So just pa-pa-patriotically declare
He's your uncle, he's your uncle, not your dad
You know I can be found,
sitting home all alone,
If you can't come around, 
at least please telephone.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Baby, if I made you mad 
for something I might have said,
Please, let's forget the past, 
the future looks bright ahead,
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I don't want no other love,
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.
Don't stop thinking of me, 
don't make me feel this way,
Come on over here and love me, 
you know what I want you to say.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Why should we be apart?
I really love you baby, cross my heart.
Let's walk up to the preacher 
and let us say I do,
Then you'll know you'll have me, 
and I'll know that I'll have you,
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I don't want no other love,
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I don't want no other love,
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.
Let the stars fade and fall
And I won't care at all
As long as I have you
Every kiss brings a thrill
And I know that it will
As long as I have you
Let's think of the future
Forget the past
You're not my first love
But you're my last
Take the love that I bring
Then I'll have everything
As long as I have you
Let's think of the future
Forget the past
You're not my first love
But you're my last
Take the love that I bring
Then I'll have everything
As long as I have you
As long, as long as I have you
I said I'd hold, I said I'd hold, 
I said I'd hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms 
Like you've never been held before 
Well I'll think of you each day and then I'll dream the night away 
Oh, 'till you are in my arms once more 
The stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why 
I feel so blue 'cause I'm away from you 
Yeah I'll hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms 
Oh darling please wait for me 
You know the stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why 
I feel so blue 'cause I'm away, I'm away from you 
Yeah I'll hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms 
Oh darling please wait for me 
The stars up in the sky you know they know the reason why... 
I feel so blue 'cause I'm away, I'm away, I'm away, I'm away from you 
I said, I said I'd hold you in my heart, heart, heart 'till I can hold you in my arms 
Oh darling please wait for me 
The stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why 
I, I feel so blue 'cause I'm away, I'm away from you 
Yeah, I'll hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms 
Oh darling please wait for me 
Shackled by a heavy burden
Need the Lord again and shame
Then the hand of Jesus touched me
And now I am no longer the same
For He touched me, He touched me
He touched me and what a wonderful joy
What wonderful joy that foods my soul
Something happened and now I know
He touched me and made me whole
Oh since I met this blessed Savior
And since he cleaned and me me whole
Oh I never cease, never cease to prise Him
I'll shout it while eternity rolls
Oh He touched me, oh He touched me
And oh what a joy that floods my soul
Something happened and now I know
He touched me and made me whole
I said, "Three corn patches about four cotton fields away"
I said, "Three corn patches about four cotton fields away
Lives the prettiest girl in the whole darn U.S.A", I said a
She's got big brown eyes and long black wavy hair
She's got big brown eyes and long black wavy hair
She's so beautiful, people, it don't seem fair
Well, I've been to Chicago, been to New Orleans
Yes, I've been to Chicago, been to New Orleans
But I'd rather see my baby, workin' in her old blue jeans
I said, "Three corn patches about four cotton fields away"
I said, "Three corn patches about four cotton fields away
Lives the prettiest girl in the whole darn U.S.A", I said a
She keeps a big bulldog out in the yard all night
She keeps a big bulldog out in the yard all night
Well he barks like he's bare, but he don't bite
I said, "Three corn patches about four cotton fields away"
I said, "Three corn patches about four cotton fields away
Lives the prettiest girl in the whole darn U.S.A", I said a
I said, "Three corn patches about four cotton fields away"
I said, "Three corn patches about four cotton fields away"
I said, "Three"
I cry myself to sleep each night
Wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
And the pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin'
Since you're gone
It keeps right on a'hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
The pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
It keeps right on a'hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
Yes, it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
Don't do that, please stop it
Please stop it now
You know I can't take it
Please stop it now
My head is spinning a spell on me now
My head is spinning around and around
My head is spinning around and around
Your witchcraft has got me
Keep going down and down
Let me forget her, don't mention her name
You know it brings back that old burning flame
It hurts to know that she doesn't feel the same
I can't go on since she left me alone
My one desire now is to cry, now to cry
She might come back one day by and by and by
All you got is one life
Living once can be rough
But if you live every day all the way
Once is enough
You can own just one suit
Worn and torn at the cuff
But if you're livin' the life that you love
Once is enough
What's the good of reaching ninety
If you waste eighty-nine
You got one life so live it
If you don't it's a crime
Life's a playful puppy
You can grab by the scruff
And if you live every sec' what the heck
Once is enough
Never wait until tomorrow
What if it never comes
Life is a seven layer
Don't you settle for crumbs
Life's a playful puppy
You can grab by the scruff
And if you live every sec' what the heck
Once is enough
And if you live every sec' what the heck
Once is enough
And if you live every sec' what the heck
Once is enough
Ten thousand miles even though I roam
I can hear the call of the hills of home
The canyons high and the valleys low
Echo "How can you stay away"
My dreams are there where the eagle flies
Where the mountain tops seem to touch the sky
The winding streams and the winds that blow
Ask me "How can you stay away"
Far too long have I stayed apart
From this land that I love and divide my heart
Now, now I know I must go
Where the hills say "Don't stay away"
Where the hills say "Don't stay away"
Kauai, island of love
Lovely princess of the islands
Kauai, island of love
Listen, can't you hear her calling
Aloha welcome my love
Her palmtrees gently do the hula
While her slaves, the waves
Rush in to kiss her shores
Heaven is another name for
Kauai, island of love
It's a lonely man
Who wanders all around
It's a lonely man
Who roams from town to town
Searchin', always searchin'
For something he can't find
Hopin', always hopin'
That some day fate will be kind
It's a lonely man
Who travels all alone
When he has no one
That he can call his own
Always so unhappy
Taking shelter where he can
Here I am
Come meet a lonely, lonely man
Always so unhappy
Taking shelter where he can
Here I am
Come meet a lonely, lonely man
Here I am
Come meet a lonely, lonely man
(words & music by j.a. balthrop)
Oh, it won't seem like christmas, oh, without you
Far too many miles are between
But if I get the one thing I'm waiting for
Well then I'll se you tonight in my dreams
Seems a long time since we've been together
It was just about to this time of the year
Looks like it's gonna be snowy weather
How I wish that you could be here
But it won't seem like christmas, oh, without you
Far too many miles are between
But if I get the one thing that I'm wishing for
Then I'll see you tonight in my dreams
In the distance I hear sleigh bells ringing
The holly is so pretty this year
And the carol that somebody's singing
Reminds me of our christmas last year
Hey Jude, don't be a fool
Take a sad song and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't let me down
Take a sad song and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Let it out and let in
Hey Jude begin
To making the world a little better
Don't you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
In making the world a little better
Hey Jude, don't let me down
Take a sad song and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Let it out and let in
Hey Jude begin
To making the world a little better
Don't you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
In taking the world upon your shoulder
Hey Jude, don't let me down
Take a sad song and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Na na na na na na na

A very old friend came by today 
'Cause he was telling everyone in town 
Of the love that he just found 
And Marie's the name of his latest flame 
He talked and talked and I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
The prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name of his latest flame 
Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burning 
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye 
He was gone but still his words kept returning 
What else was there for me to do but cry 
Would you believe that yesterday 
This girl was in my arms and swore to me 
She'd be mine eternally 
And Marie's the name of his latest flame 
Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burning 
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye 
He was gone but still his words kept returning 
What else was there for me to do but cry 
Would you believe that yesterday 
This girl was in my arms and swore to me 
She'd be mine eternally 
And Marie's the name of his latest flame 
Yeah Marie's the name of his latest flame 
Oh Marie's the name of his latest flame
I said blue moon of Kentucky
keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
I said blue moon of Kentucky
keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well, it was on one moonlight night
Stars shining bright
Wish blown high
Love said good-bye
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well, I said blue moon of Kentucky
Just keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
I said blue moon of Kentucky
keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well, it was on one moonlight night
Stars shining bright
Wish blown high
Love said good-bye
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Nothingville
Only just a two bit town
Where nothing's real
They treat me like a country clown
Nothingville
I ain't gonna keep a-hangin' 'round
The doors keep slammin' in my face
People keep puttin' me in my place
It's a rat's race at a snail's pace
Nothingville, Nothingville
Nothingville
It Is No Secret(words & music by stuart hamblin)
The chimes of time ring out the news,
Another day is through.
Someone slipped and fell.
Was that someone you? 
You may have longed for added strength,
Your courage to renew.
Do not be disheartened,
For I have news for you.
It is no secret what God can do.
What he's done for others, he'll do for you.
With arms wide open, he'll pardon you.
It is no secret what God can do.
There is no night for in his light
You never walk alone.
Always feel at home,
Wherever you may go.
There is no power can conquer you
While God is on your side.
Take him at his promise,
Don't run away and hide.
It is no secret what God can do.
What he's done for others, he'll do for you.
With arms wide open, he'll pardon you.
It is no secret what God can do.
Somewhere in, in the distant night
I hear Christmas bells
The gentle snow keeps falling down on people
Who are homeward bound
That's the it's always been
The circle really never ends
Christmas seems to come and go
From the place that I don't know
Holly leaves and Christmas trees
It's that time of year
Lights aglow and mistletoe
Don't mean a thing when you're not here
As I walk, walk this lonely street
The sound of snow beneath my feet
I'll think of how it used to be
Holly leaves and Christmas trees 
Use to mean so much to me
There's a brand new day on the horizon
Everything's gonna be just fine
There's a brand new day on the horizon
And the whole world's gonna be mine
I'm gonna tell old trouble, he'd better be moving on
Happiness is going to take his place around here from now on
The old dark clouds are gonna roll away
The sun is gonna shine
And the whole world's gonna be mine
I'm gonna tell old heartaches, pack his bags and go
I've decided that I don't want him hanging around no more
Don't you know I said everything's gonna be just fine
'Cause the whole world's gonna be mine
I'm gonna chase away old problems till they're out of sight
And I guarantee you honey they won't be coming back
Well don't you know I said everything's gonna be all right
'Cause the whole world's gonna be mine
I know my luck's gonna change, just you wait and see
Startin' tomorrow only good things in life are going to come to me
There's a brand new day on the horizon
And the whole world's gonna be mine
And the whole world's gonna be mine
I'll take you home again, kathleen (thomas p. westendorf)
I will be true (ivory joe hunter)
It's been so long darling (ernest tubb)
Apron strings (weiss/schroeder)
There's no tomorrow (hoffman - corday - carr)
I'll take you home again kathleen
Across the ocean wild
To where your heart has ever been
Since first you were my bonny bride
The roses all have left your cheek
I watch them fade away and die
Your voice is soft when you speak
And tears bedim your lovely eyes
Oh, I will take you home kathleen
Across the ocean wild
And when the fields are soft and green
I will take you to your home kathleen
Somehow I feel
That someday we'll meet again
Don't ask me how
It's something I can't explain
Until the day
I give up all hope of you
Assure yourself this I'll do
I will be true
It's been so long darling
Since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long darling
But now I realize
'bout your love, not seeing you,
It hurts me through and through
It's been so long darling
Well, I'm coming back to you
Tadadada ... ? ... apron strings
There tatatatata
There's no tomorrow
When love isn't near
In my father's house are many mansions
If it were not true he would have told me so
He has gone away to live in that bright city
He's preparing me a mansion there I know
Jesus died upon the cross to bear my sorrow
Freely died that souls like you might have new life
But I know that soon there'll come a bright tomorrow
When the world will all be free from sin and strife
(Do not shun the saviors love, from up in glory)
(Or you won't be there to sing the gospel story)
In my father's house are many mansions
If you're true then to this land you'll surely go
(Words & music by R. Bourke)
The first time I saw you I knew I was hooked on somebody other than me
The first time I held you, your soft lips and blue eyes
Were as far as my eyes could see
Yes here in my arms I knew I had found the reason that I'm living for
And I felt the feeling, such a wonderful feeling
That I'd never felt before
Baby, you're love's been a long time coming
Baby your love's got a hold on me
Baby your love's sure got me humming
Baby your love's been a long time coming
Deep in my heart there's a feeling I never knew
Until I saw a love that was very new
I'm gonna tell everyone what good love can do
Baby, you're love's been a long time coming
Baby your love's got a hold on me
Baby your love's sure got me humming
Baby your love's been a long time coming
Baby, you're love's been a long time coming
Baby your love's got a hold on me
One thought of you, 
my heart begins churning
I feel return 
to a fountain of love
My lips and eyes, 
they ache to be near you
To hold you here 
in my fountain of love
Never be blue 
should your world start sinking
Just come and drink 
from my fountain of love
We'll build a new world off 
on a high mountain
We'll live 
on our fountain of love
Up above my head there is music in the air
Up above my head there is music in the air
Up above my head there is music in the air, oh yeah!
And I really do believe, I really do believe
I really do believe there's a heaven somewhere
There's a heaven somewhere
Shake... the little tambourine
Shake a-ring a jing -jing a-ling
Shake, shake my little dancin' queen
Shake that tambourine, that tambourine
I can hear them dancing, in the marketplace
Swishin' and a-swirlin', in their' silks and lace
Bracelets keep a-clinking, on their' tiny feet
And with their tambourines they keep the beat
Rings on their fingers, bells on their toes
They make music, wherever they go
Pound that little drum now, tap on it with your thumb
Shake, shake the little tambourine
Shake a-ring a-jing-a-ling-a-ling
Shake,shake my little dancin' queen
That tambourine, that tambourine
I heard their talent, open palace doors
Every night they're dancin', on those marble floors
Kings may bow before them, but they'll be my own
Then they'll shake their thing for me alone
Rings on their fingers, bells on their toes
They make music, wherever they go
Pound that little drum now, tap on it with your thumb
Shake, shake the little tambourine
Shake a-ring a-jing-a-ling-a-ling
Shake,shake my little dancin' queen
That tambourine, that tambourine
I will be true
No matter what they may say
I will be true
Although you're far, far away
Each night I pray
All day I'll say silent prayers
That when I open my door
I'll find you there
Somehow I feel
That someday we'll meet again
Don't ask me how
It's something I can't explain
Until the day
I give up all hope of you
Assure yourself this, I'll do
I will be true
That someday we'll meet again
Don't ask me how
It's something I can't explain
Until the day
I give up all hope of you
Assure yourself this, I'll do
I will be true
Tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested, though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
When death has come and taken our loved ones
Leaving our homes so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder how others prosper
Living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Love me tender, 
love me sweet, 
never let me go.

Now, I'm a U.S. male 'cause I was born
In a Mississippi town on a Sunday morn
Now Mississippi just happens to occupy a place
In the southeastern portion of this here United States
Now that's a matter of fact, buddy
And you know it well so I just call myself the U.S. male
That's M A L E, son, that's me
Now I said all that to say all this
I've been watchin' the way
You've been watchin' my miss
For the last three weeks you been hot on her trail
And you kinda upset this U.S. male
You touch her once with your greasy hands
I'm gonna stretch your neck like a long rubber band
She's wearin' a ring that I bought her on sale
And that makes her the property of this U.S. male
You better not mess with the U.S. male my friend
U.S. male gets mad, he's gonna do you in
You know what's good for yourself son
You better find somebody else son
Don't tamper with the property of the U.S. male
Alright, alright we tell it like it is
Through the rain and the heat and the sleet and the snow
The U.S. male is on his toes
Quit watchin' my woman, 'cause that ain't wise
You ain't pullin' no wool over this boy's eyes
I catch you 'round my woman, champ
I'm gonna leave your head 'bout the shape of a stamp
Kinda flattened out, so you'll do well
To quit playin' games with this U.S. male
You better not mess with the U.S. male, my friend
U.S. male gets mad, he's gonna do you in
You know what's good for yourself, son
You better find somebody else, son
Don't tamper with the property of the U.S. male
Sock it to me one time, oh yeah baby
All right now I'm gonna tell it like it is son
I catch you messin' 'round with that woman of mine
I'm gonna lay one on you man
You're talkin' to the U.S. male, the American U.S. male
Well so long
Oh how I hate to see you go
Yes so long
Oh how I hate to see you go
Well the way that I will miss you
I guess you'll never know
We've been together so long
To have to separate this way
We've been together so long
To have to separate this way
Well I'm gonna let you go ahead on baby
But let you come back home some day
Play the blues boys, play the blues
One more time
You said you once had loved me
But now I guess you've changed your mind
You said you once had loved me
But now I guess you've changed your mind
Why don't you reconsider baby
Give yourself just a little more time
Sweetheart we're alone
And you are mine
Let's make this night a night to remember
Don't make our love a cold dying ember
For with the dawn, you'll be gone
Hold me close in your arms as the night withers away
Let's not waste one precious kiss while we're together
Oh please come to my arms and say you'll love me forever
For with the dawn, you'll be gone
Sweetheart when you're near
My heart is aflame
Your lips pressed on mine is heaven descending
And I could die because it is ending
For with the dawn, you'll be gone
Let these passions we feel in our hearts never end
I could never share this feeling with another
Oh please say that you feel the same knowing no other ??
For with the dawn, you'll be gone
For with the dawn, you'll be gone
For with the dawn, you'll be gone
For with the dawn, you'll be gone
Well, well, well
Just because you think you're so pretty
And just because your momma thinks you're hot
Well, just because you think you've got somethin'
That no other girl has got
You've caused me to spend all my money
You laughed and called me old Santa Claus
Well, I'm telling you
Baby, I'm through with you
Because, well well just because
Well, well, well
There'll come a time when you'll be lonesome
And there'll come a time when you'll be blue
Well, there'll come a time when old Santa
He won't pay your bills for you
You've caused me to lose all my women
And now, now you say we are through
Well, I'm telling you
Baby, I was through with you
A long, long, long time ago
Well, just because you think you're so pretty
And just because your mama thinks
You're the hottest thing in town
Well, just because you think you've got somethin'
That nobody else ha-has got
You've caused me to spend all of my money
Honey, you laughed and called me your old Santa Claus
Well, I'm telling you I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because
She wears my ring to show the world that she belongs to me
She wears my ring to show the world she's mine eternally
With loving care I placed it on her finger
To show my love for all the world to see
This tiny ring is a token of tender emotion
An endless pool of love that's as deep as the ocean
She swears to wear it with eternal devotion
That's why I sing because she wears my ring
She swears to wear it with eternal devotion
That's why I sing because she wears my ring
This tiny ring is a token of tender emotion
An endless pool of love that's as deep as the ocean
She swears to wear it with eternal devotion
That's why I sing because she wears my ring
That's why I sing because she wears my ring
(words & music by joy byers)
I'll send you red roses by the dozen
I'll call you sweet little things like turtle dove
I'll whisper pretty things in your ear
The kinda things a girl likes to hear
Baby, if you'll give me all of your love
I'll bring you pounds and pounds of chocolate candy
To prove it's you that I've been thinking of
Tear up all the pictures I own of every pretty girl I've ever known
Baby, if you'll give me all of your love
I'll take you dancin' every night until you're ready to drop
I'll kiss your sweet red cherry lips until you holler stop
Every night I'll serenade you 'neath your window
If you need me just a whistle and I won't need a shove
I'll hug you squeeze you tight as I can
It ain't gonna be no one-night stand
Baby, if you'll give me all of your love
I'll take you dancin' every night until you're ready to drop
I'll kiss your sweet red cherry lips until you holler stop
Every night I'll serenade you 'neath your window
If you need me just a whistle and I won't need a shove
I'll hug you squeeze you tight as I can
It ain't gonna be no one-night stand
Baby, if you'll give me all of your love
Baby, if you'll give me all of your love
If you will give me, if you will give me all your love

I'm gonna go where the desert sun is
Go where I know the fun is
Go where the harem girls dance
Go where there's love and romance
Out on the burning sands, in some caravan
I'll find adventure, while I can
To say the least, go on, go east young man
Go east young man, go east young man
You'll feel like a sheik, so rich and grand
With dancing girls at your command
Go eat and drink and feast, go east young man
I'm gonna go where the night's enchanted
Go where those dreams are granted
When paradise starts calling, into some tent I'm crawling
I hear those desert drums, and when nighttime comes
Then I'll make love the way I planned
To say the least, go on, go east young man
Go east young man, go east young man
You'll feel like a sheik, so rich and grand
With dancing girls at your command
Go eat and drink and feast, go east young man
Go eat and drink and feast, go east young man

How many girls choose cotton dress worlds
When they could have satins and lace
And stand by her man, never once letting shade touch her face
How many hearts could live through all the winters
We've known and still not be cold?
True love travels on a gravel road
Love is a stranger and hearts are in danger
On smooth streets paved with gold
Oh, true love travels on a gravel road, oh
Down through the years we've had hard times and tears
But they only helped our love grow
And we'll stay together no matter how strong the wind blows
Not once have I seen your blue eyes filled with envy
Or stray from the one that you hold
Oh, true love travels on a gravel road
Love is a stranger and hearts are in danger
On smooth streets paved with gold
Oh, true love travels on a gravel road
Yeah, true love travels on a gravel road
True love travels on a gravel road
(Words & music by Gordon Lightfoot)
That's what you get for loving me
That's what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone, you can see
That's what you get for loving me
Now don't you shed a tear for me
I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I've had a hundred just like you
But don't be blue I'll have a thousand before I'm through
That's what you get for loving me
That's what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone, you can see
That's what you get for loving me
Now there you go, you're cryin' again
You should have known how things would end
But then some day when your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass this way again
That's what you get for loving me
That's what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone, you can see
That's what you get for loving me
That's what you get for loving me
That's what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone, you can see
That's what you get for loving me
Every time I look at someone new
Tell me why I think of you
Then you sometimes ask me by
You're playing with love
Darling tell me why
You left me all alone
To cry over you
My heart is torn and broken
There's nothing left to do
In my prayers, I'll mention you
When you're gone I feel so blue
Why can't I have all of you
Oh, somebody, please tell me why
You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me
No, you don't know the one
Who thinks of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight
To you I am just a friend
And that's all I've ever been
No, you don't know me
For I never knew the art of making love
No, my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too
You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
Too never, never know
The one who love you so
No, you don't know me
Gentleman songsters off on a spree
Doomed from here to eternity
Lord have mercy on such as we
Baa Baa Baa
Follow that dream, I got to follow that dream
Keep a-moving, move along, keep a moving
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
When your heart gets restless, time to move along
When your heart gets weary, time to sing a song
But when a dream is calling you
There's just one thing that you can do
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
Keep a-moving, move along, keep a moving
Got to find me someone whose heart is free
Someone to look for my dream with me
And when I find her, I may find out
Just what my dreams are all about
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving, move along
Keep a-moving, move along
Elvis:
I'll have a blue christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of read on a green christmas tree
Won't be the same dear if you're not here with me
Martina McBride:
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doing allright with your christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue christmas
Elvis:
I'll have a blue christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Martina McBride:
You'll be doing allright with your christmas of white
Elvis and Martina McBride:
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue christmas
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue christmas
Big Boots
They call your daddy Big Boots
And Big Boots is his name
It takes a big man to wear big boots
That's your daddy's claim to fame
They know your daddy Big Boots
Wherever soldiers are
'Cause he can handle an armored tank
Just like a kiddy car
So sleep little soldier
Don't you cry
Loo loo loo loo
Loo loo loo
General sandman's soon coming by
Loo loo loo loo
Loo loo loo
I'm gonna tell you a little secret
You won't believe it's true
Did you know your
Daddy Big Boots
Once wore little boots like you
The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and the lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Yeah, down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and the lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize I was only dreamin'
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak again
I'll touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old tree
As I lay me in the green, green grass of home
There goes my only possession
Oh there goes my everything
I hear footsteps slowly walking
As they gently walk across the lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying
Darling this will be goodbye for ever more
There goes my reason for living
Oh there goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
Oh there goes my everything
As my memory turns back the pages
I can see the happy years we've had before
Now the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of the door
There goes my reason for living
Oh there goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
Oh there goes my everything
There goes my only possession
Oh there goes my everything
I need you so to keep me happy
If I can't have you, I cannot go on
I need your arms around me tightly
Yes, I miss them badly when you're not at home
When the day is done, I miss you so
I lie and wait to hear you knock upon the door
When you leave me, I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry 'cause I need you so
When the day is done, I miss you so
I lie and wait to hear you knock upon the door
When you leave me, I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry 'cause I need you so
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
[Incomprehensible] ends meet
Saturday morning arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creep in like a nun
Friday's child forget to tie his suitcase
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder if you're having fun making ends meet
You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray, the Lord, that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day
I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind
Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord
You'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind
Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way
(words & music by sid tepper - roy bennett)
I'm a poor hawaiian beach boy
A long way from the beach
'cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can
I was minding my own business
But drinking daddy's juice
I swear I'll never touch that stuff again
Just like a pig before he gave his all that aluhau
I'm in the pen
Got those beach boy blues
Don't the time go slow
Lonely beach boy blues
Only 30 day's and 90 years to go
I want a taste of honey
From my wahini's lips
I want to be her ever loving man
But I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can
But I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can

Well, now sweetheart you done me wrong
You have left me all alone
Maybe there will come a time
Sweetheart, when you will change your mind
The road is rough
And rocky too, and [Incomprehensible]
Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old things they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland
Oh, I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie
'Cause Dixieland, that's where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on
So hush little baby
Don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
But all my trials, Lord, will soon be over
I gave a letter to the postman,
he put it his sack.
bright and early next morning,
he brought my letter back.
She wrote upon it:
Return to sender, address unknown.
No such number, no such zone.
We had a quarrel, a lover's spat
I write I'm sorry but my letter keeps coming back.
So then I dropped it in the mailbox 
And sent it special D.
bright and early next morning 
it came right back to me.
She wrote upon it:
Return to sender, address unknown.
No such person, no such zone.
This time I'm gonna take it myself
and put it right in her hand.
And if it comes back the very next day 
then I'll understand the writing on it
Return to sender, address unknown.
No such number, no such zone.
return to sender
return to sender
return yo sender
You got the huggin'est arms
The thrillin'est eyes
You're just my style
And you're just the right size
Gonna stop
Uh, shoppin' around
I'm gonna stop
Shoppin' around 'cause I found the girlie I'm lookin' for
Oh, the very first time
You touched my lips
Took my little red book
And tore it to bits
Ain't gonna be
Searchin' no more
I'm gonna stop
Shoppin' around 'cause I found the girlie I'm lookin' for
Ain't no other dolly I'm wantin' to hold
Hey, hey, baby
I really am sold on you
Ooh, ooh, such a pretty little package
I never did see
Gonna wrap you up and take you home with me
I'm thrilled like never before
I'm gonna stop
Shoppin' around 'cause I found the girlie I'm lookin' for
Ain't no other dolly I'm wantin' to hold
Hey, hey, baby
I really am sold on you
Ooh, ooh, such a pretty little package
I never did see
Gonna wrap you up and take you home with me

I'm gonna stop
Shoppin' around 'cause I found the girlie I'm lookin' for
I'm gonna stop
Uh shoppin' around
I'm gonna stop
Uh shoppin' around
I'm gonna stop
Shoppin' around
I see a change is coming to our lives
It's not the same as it used to be
And it's not too late to realize our mistake
We're just not right for each other
Love has slipped away, left us only friends
We almost seem like strangers
All that's left between us are the memories we shared
Of times we thought we cared for each other
There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us
Some day when she's older maybe she will understand
Why her mom and dad are not together
The tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye
Will tear at my heart forever
There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us
I need Jesus to guide me every day
As I'm travellin' along this rough and narrow way
Though afflictions fill my soul
I'm determined to make the goal
I've gotta have Jesus 'cause I just can't make it by myself
Every day I pray (pray) pray (pray)
Pray (pray) pray (pray)
I pray (pray) pray (pray
Pray pray pray
Pray and ask the Lord Jesus
Don't leave me by myself
Every mornin' through the years I pray
You know I've got to have Jesus
I just can't it by myself
By myself
If they say we were doin' wrong
If they say we were out too long
Well, you can say
My arms were just too strong
Put the blame, put the blame on me
Felt so good when I held you tight
Couldn't stop when we kissed goodnight
So if they tell us we don't heave the right
Put the blame, put the blame on me
What I feel is deep inside
This is real and I won't hide
Go ahead, use my name
I'll be proud to take the blame
You just did what I made you do
You love me and I love you
So if the way they talk can bother you
Put the blame, put the blame on me
Hey baby, I ain't askin' much of you
No no no no no no no no baby, I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do
Don't be a stingy little mama
You're 'bout to starve me half to death
Well you can spare a kiss or two and
Still have plenty left, no no no
Baby, I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do
You're just a natural born beehive
Filled with honey to the top
Well I ain't greedy baby
All I want is all you got, no no no
Baby, I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do
I got wishbone in my pocket
I got a rabbit's foot 'round my wrist
You know I'd have all the things these lucky charms could bring
If you'd give me just one sweet kiss, no no no no no no no
Baby, I ain't askin' much of you
Just a big-a big-a hunk o' love will do
I hear the bells
Saying Christmas is near
They ring out to tell the world
That this is the season of cheer
I hear a choir
Singing sweetly somewhere
And a glow fills my heart
I'm at peace with the world
As the sound of their singing fills the air
Oh why can't every day be like Christmas
Why can't that feeling go on endlessly
For if everyday could be just like Christmas
What a wonderful world this would be
I hear a child
Telling Santa what to bring
And the smile upon his tiny face
Is worth more to me than anything
Sentimental me, guess I'll always be
So in love with you, say you love me too
Sentimental me
Dreaming while I live, living just to give
All my love to you, no one else will do
Sentimental me
Reaching for the moon
And no wishing on the stars
On my honeymoon
I want to be where you are
Darling, can't you see? It was meant to be
I'm in love with you, say you love me too
Sentimental me
Reaching for the moon
And no wishing on the stars
On my honeymoon
I want to be where you are
Darling, can't you see? It was meant to be
I'm in love with you, no one else will do
Sentimental me
If you let the stars keep telling you
Who to love and not to love
You may never find contentment for your heart
You could go unloved forever and darling that means never
Surrender to love, let's forget about the stars
You say that stars have promised you true love ten thousand times
But here you are with a broken heart and mind
I can tell you want to love me from the beating in your heart
Surrender to love, let's forget about the stars
Let's forget about the stars, come follow me my dove
To a world just like the world that you've been dreaming of
Let's not wait too long for something might go wrong
Surrender to love, let's forget about the stars
Let's forget about the stars
Let's forget about the stars
Let's forget about the stars
In the early mornin' rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early mornin' rain
With no place to go
Out on runway number nine
Big 707 set to go
Well, I'm out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
She's rolling out at last
Hear the mighty engines roar
  (Hear the mighty engines roar )
See the silver wing on high
  (See the silver wing on high )
She's away and westward bound
For above the clouds she flies
Where the mornin' rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This ol' airport's got me down
It's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be
Can't jump a jet plane
  (Can't jump a plane)
Like you can a freight train
  (Like a freight train )
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
Please don't stop loving me
You were born just to be in my arms
In my arms
Please don't stop loving me
Your lips were made just to be kissed by me
Kissed by me
When I'm with you
I don't know day from night, wrong from right
You are my world, that's all I know
I love you so, I won't let go
Please don't stop loving me
Darling you'll always be mine alone
Mine alone
I will spend my whole life through
Loving you, just loving you
Winter, summer, springtime too
Loving you, loving you
Makes no difference where I go or what I may do
You know that I'll always be loving you, just you
And if I'm seen with someone new
Don't be blue, don't you be blue
I'll be faithful, I'll be true
Always true, true to you
There is only one for me and you know who
You know that I'll always be loving you
As you listen to the band
Don't you get a bubble?
As you listen to them play
Don't you get a glow?
If you step out on the floor
You'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance
You'll forget your woe, so
Come, get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go
Come, hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?
Let yourself go
Let yourself go, relax
And let yourself go, relax
You got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot, so
Come, cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer "No, sir"
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
Let yourself go
Come, get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go
Come, hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?
Let yourself go
Let yourself go, relax
And let yourself go, relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot, so
Come, cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer "No, sir"
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
I saw old pharaoh's daughter bring Moses from the water
I'll lick the guy that says it isn't so
I was born about ten thousand years ago
There ain't nothing in this world that I don't know
I saved king David's life and he offered me a wife
I said now you're talking business have a chair
Yeah, I was born about ten thousand years ago
Ain't nothing in this world that I don't know
Saw Peter, Paul and Moses playing ring around the roses
I'll lick the guy that says it isn't so
I was born about ten thousand years ago
Ain't nothing in this world that I don't know
I saw old pharaoh's daughter bring Moses from the water
I'll lick the guy that says it isn't so
I was there when old Noah built the ark
And I crawled in the window after dark
I saw Jonah eat the whale and dance with the lion's tale
And I crossed over Canaan on a log
I was born about ten thousand years ago
Ain't nothing in this world that I don't know
I saw old pharaoh's daughter bring Moses from the water
I'll lick the guy that says it isn't so
Yeah, I was born about ten thousand years ago
Ain't nothing in this world that I don't know
Saw Peter, Paul and Moses playing ring around the roses
I'll lick the guy that says it isn't so
I was there when old Noah built the ark
And I crawled in the window after dark
I saw Jonah eat the whale and dance with the lion's tale
And I crossed over Canaan on a log
I was born about ten thousand years ago
There ain't nothing in this world that I don't know
I saved king David's life and he offered me a wife
I said now you're talking business have a chair
Yeah, I was born about ten thousand years ago
Ain't nothing in this world that I don't know
Saw Peter, Paul and Moses playing ring around the roses
I'll lick the guy that says it isn't so
Young as a circus parade, it's a wonderful world
Pretty as pink lemonade, it's a wonderful world
Life is a carnival, live it for all your worth
You are the star of the greatest show on earth
This big wide world is a clown with his nose painted red
A rainbow colored balloon's dancing high overhead
It's everyone's oyster, step up get your pearl
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
This big wide world is a clown with his nose painted red
A rainbow colored balloon's dancing high overhead
It's everyone's oyster, step up get your pearl
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
Old Macdonald had a farm, ee-i-ee-i-o
And on that farm he had some chicks, ee-i-ee-i-o
With a cluck, cluck here, a cluck, cluck there
Loud as they could be
And when those chicks got out of line
Chicken fricasse
With a cluck, cluck here, a cluck, cluck there
Loud as they could be
And when those chicks got out of line
Chicken fricasse
Well, Old Macdonald had a farm, ee-i-ee-i-o
And on that farm he had some cows, ee-i-ee-i-o
With a moo, moo here, a moo, moo there
Cattle everywhere
And when those cows got out of line
Hamburger, medium rare
With a moo, moo here, a moo, moo there
Cattle everywhere
And when those cows got out of line
Hamburger, medium rare
Ohh, Well, Old Macdonald had a farm, ee-i-ee-i-o
And on that farm he had some pigs, ee-i-ee-i-o
With an oink, oink here, an oink, oink there
Pigs everywhere in sight
And when those pigs got out of line
Pork and beans at night
With an oink, oink here, an oink, oink there
Pigs everywhere in sight
And when those pigs got out of line
Pork and beans at night
Well I'm goona have a farm one day, ee-i-e-i-o
And I'll do things McDonalds way, ee-i-e-i-o
With a cluck, cluck here, a cluck, cluck there
A moo, moo here, a moo, moo there
An oink, oink here, an oink, oink there
And I can promise you
If those animals ever get out of line
We'll have a mulligan stew
How about you?
Long distance information give me Memphis, Tennessee
Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number but I know who placed the call
My uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall
Help me information to get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the southside, high upon a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge
Help me information more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
Tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee
The last time I saw Marie she was waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
Marie is only six years old, Information please
Try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee
I'm with a crowd but oh so alone
I still have the picture you sent me
And you signed it with love you recall
And the one of me that you wanted
Is now hanging face to the wall
At night I'm never alone
I'm afraid that I'll weaken and phone
And I'm afraid that you will be gone
I'm with a crowd but oh so alone
There's a sweet sweet spirit in this place
And I know that it's the spirit of the Lord
There are sweet expressions on each face
And I know that it's the presence of the Lord
Sweet Holy Spirit
Sweet heavenly dove
Stay right here with us
Filling us with your love
And for these blessings
We lift our hearts in praise (hearts in praise)
Without a doubt we'll know that we have been revived
When we shall leave this place
It's a matter of time before I go back there
A matter of time before I go home
I have been way from her now for a long time
And I've lived a life I thought that it should be
It's a long, long way from now to maybe sometime
And the waiting round is really killing me
It's a matter of time before I go back there
A matter of time oh Lord, before I go home
It's a long way I know and the goin' ain't easy
She'll see me again it's a matter of time
I think I'll take a train right early in the morning
Just to see how far I get along the way
But the trains don't run too often only sometimes
So I guess I'd better wait another day
It's a matter of time before I go back there
A matter of time before I go home
It's a long way I know and the goin' ain't easy
She'll see me again, it's just a matter of time
She'll see me I know it's a matter of time
Frankie and me we were lovers
Oh lordy how we could love
Swore we'd be true to each other
Just as true as stars above
I was her man, she caught me doing her wrong
My luck in poker was fading
When a new gal caught my eye
I gambled, I tried to change my luck
With a chick named Nellie Bly
I was Frankie's man but I was doing her wrong
Yeah! Frankie came looking to find me
Yes, she wasn't looking for fun
For in her sweet loving hand
She was totin' a 44 gun
To shoot her man if he was doin' her wrong
Well Frankie walked into the bar room
And right there in front of her eyes
There was her loving Johnny
Making love to that Nellie Bly
I was her man, she caught me doing her wrong
Frankie, I beg, please don't shoot me
Well they'll put you away in a cell
You know they'll put you where the cold wind blows
From the hottest corner in hell
I'm your man, I know I done you wrong
Easy on the roll, real easy
Easy on the roll, real slow
Roll me over real gently
'Cause my wound hurts me so
Well I was her man
Well I done her wrong
Well Frankie told Johnny
Well this is the end of my song
I was her man, well I done her wrong
Well , hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Done her wrong
(words & music by wayne - weisman)
The shooting stars are coming out of your eyes
They point the way, the way to paradise
I got a funny feeling, I can't be wrong
It won't be long until the sparks will fly
It won't be long
I hear a buzz, buzz around in my brain
But what it does, is bound to drive me insane
At a time like this I must be strong
It won't be long till the sky falls down
It won't be long
Love has taught me plenty, I'm still learning more
Anything worth having is worth the waiting for
Here I go, I'm on a one way trip
Look out below because I'm about to flip
I tell you when these lips get to that kiss
It won't be long until we're out of this world
It won't be long
Love has taught me plenty, I'm still learning more
Anything worth having is worth the waiting for
Here I go, I'm on a one way trip
Look out below because I'm about to flip
I tell you when these lips get to that kiss
It won't be long, it won't be long until we're out of this world
It won't be long
It won't be long, it won't be long until we're out of this world
It won't be long
(words & music by wise - starr)
Now adam and evil, they go hand in hand
Eve taught him sin, that's the way it all began
But every time you kiss me, my heart pounds like a drum
So trouble is a woman, trouble here I come
I'm lonely like adam, you're evil like eve
I shouldn't take forbidden fruit 'cause I believe
I'll be heading straight for heartache
I should cut loose and run
But if loving you means heartache
Heartache, here I come
You're not the angel that I dreamed about
But you're the devil I don't want to live without
A woman's a woman, a man is a man
I can't be free I'm just putty in your hands
Who cares about tomorrow, I need your love tonight
And even if you're evil, baby hold me tight
You're not the angel that I dreamed about
But you're the devil I don't want to live without
A woman's a woman, a man is a man
I can't be free I'm just putty in your hands
Who cares about tomorrow, I need your love tonight
And baby if you're evil, baby hold me tight
Hold me tight
Hold me tight
Hold me tight

I'm satisfied with just a cottage below
A little silver and a little gold
But in that city where the ransomed will shine
I want the gold one that's silver lined
I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And some day yonder, we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are pure as gold
Don't think me poor or deserted or lonely
I'm not discouraged, I'm heaven bound
I'm but a pilgrim in search of the city
I want a mansion, a harp and a crown
I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And some day yonder, we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold
Here's another dime for you, Mr. Songman
Sing the loneliness of broken dreams away, if you can
Yes it's only me and you, Mr. Songman
Take away the night sing away my hurt, Mr. Songman
In your ivory covered house, safe behind your walls of glass
You keep staring back at me like a memory from the past
Won't you sing me away to a summer night
Let me hold you in my arms again
I know memory's not re-living
But at least it's not the end
Here's another dime for you Mr. Songman
Sing the loneliness of broken dreams away, if you can
Yes it's only me and you, Mr. Songman
Won't you take away the night, sing away my hurt, Mr. Songman
Won't you sing me away to a summer night
Let me hold her in my arms again
Take away the night sing away my hurt, Mr. Songman
I've been in love so many times
I thought I knew the score
Now you've treated me so wrong
I can't take any more
And it looks like I'm never gonna fall in love again
Fall in love, I'm never gonna fall in love
I mean it, I mean it, fall in love again
I gave my heart so easily, cast aside my pride
When I saw you in his arms baby
I broke up and cried
And it looks like I'm never gonna fall in love again
That's what I'm sayin' Fall in love, No, I'm never gonna fall in love
Please don't make me fall in love again
That's why I, no, I'm never gonna fall in love
Please don't make me, don't make me, fall in love again
You like to keep me dangling on a string
'Cause you know without you my life don't mean a thing
So I beg you
Please don't drag that string around, oh no
Well, what if it should break
Oh, tell me, what would I do then
Keep that string up off the ground
Oh, yeah, remember my heart is tied to the other end
Yes, I'm your puppet, my heart is in your hand
One twist of the wrist and I jump to your command
So I beg you
Please don't drag that string around, oh no
Well, what if it should break
What would I do then
Baby, keep that string up off the ground
Oh, yeah, remember my heart is tied to the other end
I feel inside me, as sure as anything
One day I'll mean more to you than a puppet on a string
So I beg you
Please don't drag that string around, oh no
Well, what if it should break
Oh, tell me, what would I do then
Keep that string up off the ground
Oh, yeah, remember my heart is tied to the other end
I could wander the byway, rewander too
But it wouldn't be the same without you
Those familiair old places would just make me blue
'Cause it wouldn't be the same without you
I wasted my love on a careless romance
But I'd do it again, if I had the chance
I could start my life over with somebody new
But it wouldn't be the same without you
I wasted my love on a careless romance
But I'd do it again, if I had the chance
I could start my life over with somebody new
But it wouldn't be the same without you
Take off your shoes, put down your hair
Turn on the music and we'll get somewhere
Dance, dance, dance, til nose gets tan
We're gonna have us a ball on the beach
a-slicin' sand
Hug me a heap, swing me a lot
We got a lot of ocean if it gets too hot
O-o-o, o-o-o, baby, take my hand
We'll have some real rockin' fun in the sun
a-slicin' sand
Come baby, come, let's dig some holes
You'll find it's heaven with sand on you soles
Yeah!
Slide through to the left, slide to the right
Slash down the middle baby hold me tight
O-o-o, o-o-o, baby, hold my hand
We'll have some real rockin' fun in the sun
slicin' sand
If you could see me now
The one who said that he'd rather roam
The one who said he'd rather be alone
If you could only see me now
If I could hold you now
Just for a moment if I could really make you mine
Just for a while turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now
I've been too long in the wind, too long in the rain
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your loving arms again
If you could hear me now
Singing somewhere in the lonely night
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight
If you could only hear me now
Oh I've been too long in the wind, too long in the rain
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your loving arms again
I can almost feel your loving arms again
Your lips, your eyes, your soft sweet sights
I feel that I've known you forever
Your style, your touch, you're just too much
I feel that I've known you forever
I know that this never happened to me
Don't have to see anymore than I see
Your face so rare, beyond compare
I feel that I've known you forever
And ever and ever
(words & music by Lou Baxter - Johnny Moore)
Merry, merry Christmas baby
Sure did treat me nice
I said merry Christmas baby
Sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise
Well I'm feeling might fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling might fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I want to kiss you baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe
I said, merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas baby
You sure did treat me nice
Yes, you did, yes, you did
Yes, you did, yes, you did
I said merry, merry Christmas baby
Sure did treat me nice
Gave me diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm puttin' it through Al's mike
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I've played a ace and I won the queen
I walked away with your heart
From a jack to a king
With no regrets I stacked, I stacked the cards, I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
You made me king of your heart
Oh for just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Oh but just in time I saw that twinkle in your eyes
From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding, wedding, wedding ring
I played an ace and I won the queen
You made me king of your heart
For just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Oh but just in time I saw, I saw that twinkle in your eyes
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding, wedding, wedding ring
I played an ace and I won the queen
You made me king of your heart
I remember, my first love affair
Somehow or another the whole darn thing went wrong
My mama had some great advice
So I thought I'd put it into words of this song
I can still hear her sayin' it
"Boy, oh, I see you're sittin' out there all alone
Cryin' your eyes out 'cause the woman that you love has gone
Oh, there's gonna be, there's gonna be a whole lot of trouble in your life
Oh, so listen to me get up off of your knees 'cause only the strong survive"
That's what she said
"Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Oh, you've got to be strong, you'd better hold on
Don't go, all around with your head hung down"
Well, I wouldn't let that little girl
No, I wouldn't let her know that she made me feel like a clown
There's a whole lot a girls, lookin' for a good man like you
Oh, but you'll never meet 'em if you give up now
And say, your life is through
And she said it
"Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Oh, you've got to be a man, you've got to take a stand
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive"
"Well, you've got to be strong, you'd better hold on
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive"
"Well, you've got to be a man, you've got to take a stand
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
Only the strong survive"
You're the one who beckoned the wind
And fanned the flame when our love began
So don't pretend you don't know me
Our names are carved on you, singing tree
Oh singing tree
Sing to me 
Call your friend 
The roving wind 
Maybe he can find my love
And bring her back, singing tree
Your leaves have turned from green to blue
Sometimes I think you loved her too
But since she left and our love died
You stand petrified, singing tree
Oh sing to me 
Singing tree 
Call your friend 
The roving wind 
Maybe he can find my love
And bring her back, singing tree
Oh sing to me 
Singing tree 
Call your friend
The roving wind
Maybe he can find my love
Danny is my name, oh yes
My name should be trouble
My name should be woe
For trouble and heartache
Is all that I know
But Danny
Yes, Danny is my name
Oh, oh, oh yes, oh yes
My life has been empty
My heart has been torn
It must have been rainy, oh yes
The night I was born
Oh Danny
Oh Danny is my name
Danny is my name
Oh, oh yes
I'm so afraid of tomorrow
So tired of today
They say that love is the answer
But love never came my way
I'm writing a letter
To someone I know
So if you should find it
And if you're alone
Oh Danny
Yes, Danny is my name
Oh, oh, oh yes
Oh Danny
Yes, Danny is my name
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Do you know who I am
Have you have any idea who I am?
Yes, it's been quite a while
And it's so good to see you again
It's so dark in this place
That I can't see your face may believe, oh, I see
Does he know who I am
And what once was between you and me?
Do you know how I tried
Have you any idea how I tried?
Not to keep you in sight
Do you know, darling, how much I cried?
I remember you said
That you had to forget about me and be free
But do you know who I am
Or have you forgot about me?
Do you think there's a chance
You and I could start over again?
Is there a prayer you still care
Or has it just been too long and we're through?
Well, what about you and him
Oh, he's only a friend, well, I see
There's still a chance for me
Well, maybe some other time, in some other place
With our love in your heart and a smile on your face
You will know who I am
When that time comes you'll know who I am
You will know who I am
When that time comes you'll know who I am
And you will know who I am
When that time comes you'll know who I am
Sandman's comin', yes he's comin'
To sprinkle you with sand
He'll say "one, two, three"
And you'll be, In cotton candy land
Sandman's comin', yes he's comin'
He'll take you, by the hand
And you'll ride upon, a big white swan
In cotton candy land
You and the swan will float upon
A cloud of pink ice cream
Where every star is a candy bar
And the moon is a marshmallow dream
Sandman's comin', yes he's comin'
Take his magic hand
Now goodnight...now sleep tight
In cotton candy land
In cotton candy land
I long to be His possession
Oh, He is my everything
I remember my days of darkness
Without sunshine or sight to lead the way
Then a whisper of His voice softly called me
To the arms of my Maker to stay
He is my reason for living
Oh He is the king of all kings
I long to be His possession
Oh, He is my everything
After the lightning and thunder
After the last bell has rung
I want to bow down before Him
And hear Him say, "Well done"
He is my reason for living
Oh He is the king of all kings
I long to be His possession
Oh, He is my everything
I long to be His possession
Oh, He is my everything
It's a long lonely highway when you're travellin' all alone
And it's a mean old world when you got no-one to call your own
And you pass through towns too small to even have a name, oh yes
But you gotta keep on goin', on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin', though there's no-one to care
Just keep movin' down the line
It's a long lonely highway without her by my side
And it's a trail full of teardrops that keep on being cried
My heart's so heavy it's a low down dirty shame oh yes
You gotta keep on goin', on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin', though there's no-one to care
Just keep movin' down the line
I gotta rock for my pillow 'neath a weeping willow
And the cool grass for my bed
My drinking water's muddy so don't you tell me buddy
That I wouldn't be better off dead
It's a long lonely highway gettin' longer all the time
And if she don't come and get me
Well, I'm gonna lose my mind
So if you read about me tell her she's the one to blame, oh yes
You gotta keep on goin', on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin', though there's no-one to care
Just keep movin' down the line
Movin' down the line
Movin' down the line
Crawfish
Well I went to the bayou just last night
There was no moon but the stars were bright
Put a big long hook on a big long pole
And I pulled Mr. Crawfish out of his hole
Crawfish
See I got him, see the size
Stripped and cleaned before your eyes
Sweet meat look, fresh and ready to cook
Crawfish
Now take Mr. Crawfish in your hand
He's gonna look good in your frying pan
If you fry him crisp or you boil him right
He'll be sweeter than sugar when you take a bite
Crawfish
See I got him, see the size
Stripped and cleaned before your eyes
Sweet meat look, fresh and ready to cook

It's a wonderful life
This life I'm livin'
What a wonderful life, days with a life of ease, oh-ho-oh
Well, I've got no job to worry me
No big bad boss to hurry me
It's a wonderful life life's good to me
It's a wonderful road
This road I'm travelin'
It's a wonderful road headin' beyond the hills, oh-ho-oh
Oh it may go straight or it may detour
But one thing that I know for sure
It's a wonderful life, life's good to me
Don't know where I'm goin'
Don't care where I'm goin'
Like the four winds are blowin' I go on
Laughin' the day away, lovin the night away
Till the moon is gone
It's a wonderful life
This life I'm livin'
What a wonderful life
Livin' the life I love, oh yeah
Well I've got neighbors, I've got friends
Just about anywhere the rainbow ends
It's a wonderful life, life's good to me
Don't know where I'm goin'
Don't care where I'm goin'
Like the four winds are blowin' I go on
Laughin' the day away, lovin the night away
Till the moon is gone
It's a wonderful life
This life I'm livin'
What a wonderful life
Livin' the life I love, oh yeah
Well I've got neighbors, I've got friends
Just about anywhere the rainbow ends
It's a wonderful life, life's good to me
What a wonderful life, life's good to me, yeah
Crazy life, life's good to me
Oh what a life
Well it's Saturday night and I just got paid
A fool about my money don't try to save
My heart says go, go have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night babe and I'm feelin' fine
I'm gonna rock it up, I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up and ball tonight
Well I got me a date and I won't be late
I picked her up in my '88
Shag on down by the social hall
When the joint starts jumpin', I'll have a ball
I'm gonna rock it up, I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna rip it up, gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up and ball tonight
Along about 10 I'll be flying high
I walk on out in the open sky
But I don't care if I spend much dough
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul
I'm gonna rock it up, I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up and ball tonight
Well it's Saturday night and I just got paid
A fool about my money don't try to save
My heart says go, go have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night babe and I'm feelin' fine
I'm gonna rock it up, I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up and ball tonight
And I love you so
That people ask me how
How I've lived 'til now
I tell them I don't know
I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
And yes, I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirits free
I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief
And once the page is read
All but love is dead
This is my belief
And yes, I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
(Words & music by Fred Wise - Dick Manning )
This was gonna be the night tonight
I was gonna get to hold you tight
But I guess we didn't plan it right
I never stood a chance, we couldn't dance
Cause there's , no room to rhumba in a sports car
You can't move forward or back
There's no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack
When a little kiss I want to steal
I hit my head against the steering wheel
Now I know the way a pretzel feels
All I can do is shout...Hey let me out!!
Cause there's , no room to rhumba in a sports car
You can't move forward or back
There's no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack
What a way to waste a day with you
Nothing happens that can tell the truth
Let's go out and find a telephone booth
Yeah that's a better place, I like more space
Cause there's , no room to rhumba in a sports car
You can't move forward or back
There's no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack
If you're looking for trouble
You came to the right place
If you're looking for trouble
Just look right in my face
I was born standing up
And talking back
My daddy was a green-eyed
Mountain jack
Because I'm evil
My middle name is misery
Well, I'm evil
So don't you mess around with me
I've never looked for trouble
But I've never ran
I don't take no orders
From no kind of man
I'm only made out
Of flesh, blood and bone
But if you're gonna start a rumble
Don't you try it on alone
Because I'm evil
My middle name is misery
Well, I'm evil
So don't you mess around with me
I'm evil, evil, evil, as can be
I'm evil, evil, evil, as can be
So don't mess around, don't mess around
Don't mess around with me
I'm evil, I'm evil, evil, evil
So don't mess around
Don't mess around with me
I'm evil, I tell you I'm evil
So don't mess around with me
Yeah
I've been traveling over mountains 
Even through the valleys, too 
I've been traveling night and day 
I've been running all the way 
Baby, trying to get to you. 
Ever since I read your letter 
Where you said you loved me true 
I've been traveling night and day 
I've been running all the way 
baby, trying to get to you 
When I read your loving letter 
Then my heart began to sing 
There were many miles between us, 
But they didn't mean a thing. 
I just had to reach you, baby, 
In spite of all that I've been through. 
I kept traveling night and day, 
I kept running all the way, 
Baby, trying to get to you. 
Well if I had to do it over 
That's exactly what I'd do, 
I would travel night and day, 
And I'd still run all the way, 
Baby, trying to get to you. 
Well, there's nothing that could hold me 
Or that could keep me away from you 
When your loving letter told me 
That you really loved me true 
Lord above me knows I love you 
It was He who brought me through, 
When my way was dark as night, 
He would shine His brightest light, 
When I was trying to get to you. 
Did you ever notice when the sun goes down
Out of nowhere comes a strange and pretty sound
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night
If you listen you can hear it in the breeze
Specially when the breeze is drifting through the trees
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night
And the murmuring waters sing the song
The echoing mountains hum along
The whispering valleys fill the air
With a whistling tune our hearts can share
It's so wonderful to walk beneath the moon
Listening to old mother nature's favorite tune
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night
Baby you've been lying to me now I'm onto you
It's the same old song but it doesn't ring true
That's right you're wrong again
Time to change and put you on your own again
You've had your way too long
Time for me to be moving on
You gotta stop, you're wrong again
Stop ... that song again
You've been steppin' out wild and fancy free
Now you've had your fun and you're running back to me
It just can't be if there's no harmony
Then stop! 
That's all let's break it up
You've had me fooled now I'm wakin' up
I see right through your lies
You made me open my eyes
You gotta stop, you're wrong again
Stop ... that song again
It's too late now I've made up my mind
Being here with you is just a waste of time
Nothing to say so I'll be on my way
Stop!
You gotta stop, you're wrong again
Stop ... that song again
It's too late now I've made up my mind
Being here with you is just a waste of time
It just can't be if there's no harmony
Then stop! Stop! you're wrong again
Stop that song again
Stop! you're wrong again
You gotta stop that song again
Stop!
Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
When through a sleepy haze I see her lying there
Soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers
Warm as the sunlight shining on her golden hair
When I awake I see her there so close beside me
I want to take her in my arms
The ache is there so deep inside me
Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her face so softly
And then my Mary wakes to love another day
And Mary's there in summer days or stormy weather
She doesn't care, or right or wrong the love we share
We share together
Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening
Kissed by the shades of night and starlight in her hair
And as we walk I hold her close beside me
All our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
If your rubberneckin' baby well that's all right with me
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
Some people say I'm wasting time yeh, but they don't really know
I like what I see I see what I like yeh, it gives me such a glow
First thing in the morning, last thing at night
I look, stare everywhere and see everything inside
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
If your rubberneckin' baby well that's all right with me
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
Some people say I'm wasting time yeh, but they don't really know
I like what I see I see what I like yeh, it gives me such a glow
Sittin' on the back porch all by myself
Along came Mary Jane with somebody else
Well, stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
Some people say I'm wasting time yeh, but I don't really care
I like what I see, I see what I like yeh, it gives me such a glow
Sittin' on the back porch all by myself
Along came Mary Jane with somebody else
Well, stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
Stop 
 
Baby let me be, 
your lovin' Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck, 
and lead me anywhere
Oh let me be 
Your teddy bear.
I don't wanna be a tiger
Cause tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind 
you love enough.
Just wanna be, your Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck 
and lead me anywhere
Oh let me be 
Your teddy bear. 
Baby let me be, around you every night
Run your fingers through my hair,
And cuddle me real tight

There's a legend of a famous matador
Who went to meet El Toro
Though he fought as he had never done before
He could not beat, El Toro
The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame
They said time would never heal the many scars
Brought by the great, El Toro
And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart
Caused him to hate, El Toro
The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame
So one night, when no-one was on sight
The matador, went to finish the score
In the lonely fields, beneath the pale moonlight
He fought the bull...and they fought once more
When they found the matador and saw him dying
He'd never see tomorrow
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying
Still walks the proud El Toro
The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame
I told her to leave me alone
That's what she's done
Just what she's done
And a house built for two, ain't a home
When it's lived in by one, one lonely one
And I can no longer hear footsteps
Come right down the hall
Here come the teardrops
Bitter they are, harder they fall
She caught me lying
Then she caught a train
And I caught a fever
Walking home in the rain, oh yeah
But it's over and I'm done
She left me once and for all
Here come the teardrops
Bitter they are, harder they fall
Here come the teardrops
Bitter they are, harder they fall
Well, I dated your big sister
And took her to a show
I went for some candy
Along came Jim Dandy
And they snuck right out of the door
Ev'ry time I see your sister
Well she's got somebody new
She's mean and she's evil
Like that old Boll Weevil
Guess I'll try my luck with you
Well, I used to pull your pigtails
And pinch your turned-up nose
But you been a growin'
And baby, it's been showin'
From your head down to your toes
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Little sister, don't you
Do what your big sister done
Yes I'm gonna walk on the milky white way
Oh Lord some of these days
I'm gonna walk that milky white way
Some of these days well well well well
I'm gonna walk up and take my stand
Gonna join that Christian band
I'm gonna walk on that milky white way
Oh Lord, some of these days

Howdy when I get home
Yes, I'm gonna tell my mother howdy,

On some of these days

About the world that I just came from
That's when we walk on the milky white way
Oh Lord, on some of these days
Well you rock my soul
Down in the bosom of Abraham
Rock, rock, rock down in the bosom of Abraham
He rocks my soul down in the bosom of Abraham
Well a rich man lives, He lives so well
Children, when he dies on a lonely hill
Why don't you rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
When was the last time you kissed me
And I don't mean a touch now and then
It's been a long time since you felt like my woman
Even longer since I felt like your man
So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends
'Cause if you don't want the love I can give you
Well, there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in
You never look at me and say, "I love you"
How much more do you think I can stand?
Oh, and there's an old friend out there and she's waiting
Lord, she's happy just holding my hand
So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends
'Cause if you don't want the love I can give you
Well, there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in
Yes, there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in
Walk down to the beach at sunset
Look as far as you can see
You will find that endless ocean
And that's how my love will always be
I bring you never ending, never ending
never ending, never ending
never ending, never ending love
Look up at the sky at midnight
Gaze up on the starlit view
Just as heaven has no boundaries
Neither does my love for you
I bring you never ending, never ending
never ending, never ending
never ending, never ending love
Never ending love 
Never ending love 
Never ending love 
Never ending love
Hey everybody gather round
N' listen to that bongo sound
Grab the first one in your reach
Now we're going to shake the beach

The joint is really jumping
The cats are going wild
The music really sends me

Gonna kick off my shoes
Roll up my faded jeans

If it's love you're looking to get
You're gonna get what you're looking for
Stop where you are
You'd better freeze
Don't pull the fire now baby
Don't be a tease
Don't start what you can't finish
I told you once before
If it's love you're looking to get
You're gonna get what you're looking for
Don't you know, you're walking on dangerous ground
Listen babe when I make love
I just don't fool around, no I don't

Once I put my hands on you baby

Don't start what you can't finish
One kiss and I want more
If it's love you're looking to get
You're gonna get what you're looking for

Pink lemonade that's dan-dan-dandy
Be a big shot for a dollar

It's carnival time
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said 'Julie baby, you're my flame
Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever yea I burn for sooth'
Captain Smith and Pocahantas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said 'Daddy o, don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his missus
Oh Daddy, won't you treat him right?
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade
We give you fever when we kiss you
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
If I get home on Christmas day
I won't need soft words to say
I'll miss you and I can stay a while
You'll see it in my eyes and when I smile
If I get home before midnight
While you're still sleeping tight
I'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
If I get home on Christmas day
Writing letters everyday
Never really seem to say
The way I feel deep in this heart of mine
Thought I'm half a world away
If we're patient and we pray
Know I'll get my chance with you this time
If I get home on Christmas day
I won't need soft words to say
I'll miss you and I can stay a while
You'll see it in my eyes and when I smile
If I get home before midnight
While you're still sleeping tight
I'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
If I get home on Christmas day
I'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
If I get home on Christmas day
Once I stood in the night
With my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as could be
And my heart felt alone and I cried oh Lord
Don't hide your face from me
Like a king I may live in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing
In this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone
Hold my hand all the way, every hour every day
Come here to the great unknown
Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone
Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone
I feel it in my leg,
I feel it in my shoe
Tell me pretty baby
If you think you feel it too
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
Send to the store
And let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight
Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and a groovin'
Gonna satisfy my soul
I've never kissed a bear
I've never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken
In the middle of the room
Now Honky Tonky Joe
Is knockin' at the door
Bring him in and fill him up
And set him on the floor
I look at you and wham, I'm head over heels
I guess that love is a banana peel
I feel so bad and yet I'm feeling so well
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell
One crazy kiss and bam, I head for the skies
I guess that love is like a cake of ice
You skate along but then you can never tell
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell
I never thought I'd get tricked by your sweet talking lies
You got a bag of tricks
And when you got busy I got dazzled and dizzy
I fell like a ton of bricks
My knees are weak, my head is spinning around
I guess that love has turned me upside down
Thought I'd get hurt, but gee, it's turning out swell
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell
I never thought I'd get tricked by your sweet talking lies
You got a bag of tricks
And when you got busy I got dazzled and dizzy
I fell like a ton of bricks
My knees are weak, my head is spinning around
I guess that love has turned me upside down
Thought I'd get hurt, but gee, it's turning out swell
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell
(arr. by elvis presley)
I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
Oh girl, you made me love you
Now, now, now your lovin' man has gone
Hear what I say
Well, I'm going away, baby
And I won't be back to fall
Well, I'm going away baby
And I won't be back to fall
And if I find me a good girl
I won't, I won't be back at all
Hear what I say, I said
See see rider,
Oh see what you have done
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We'll sip a little glass of wine
Honey, I'll gaze, I'll gaze right down
Into your eyes divine
I'm gonna feel the touch of your lips
Pressing on mine
Then I'll hear you whisper low
Just when it's time to go
Cherie, honey, I love you, so
That's my desire
When everyone thought the world was flat
Columbus said "It's round"
He went down in history
And America was found
'Cause
He had confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got
Confidence
With a "C" and an "O" and an "N" and an "F"
And an "I" and a "D" and an "ENCE"
Put 'em all together and what have you got
Confidence
You'll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
Remember the tortoise and the hare
Who had that famous race
The speedy hare wound up nowhere
And slow poke took first place
'Cause
He had confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got
Confidence
You'll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
How do you know that you can't ride a rainbow in the sky
You'll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
All you need is confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got
Confidence
With a "C" and an "O" and an "N" and an "F"
And an "I" and a "D" and an "ENCE"
Put 'em all together and what have you got
Confidence
Ku-u-i-po I love you more today
More today than yesterday
But I love you less today
Less than I will tomorrow
See the sweet Hawaiian rose
See it blossom see it grow
That's the story of our love
Ever since we said hello
As the years go passing by
We'll recall our wedding day
I will be there by your side
You will always hear me say
Ku-u-i-po, you're my Hawaiian sweetheart
Aha-ha hurry, hurry step this way
Aha-ha hurry, hurry step this way
Now the show you're going to see is strictly high class
There'll be ten hoola dancers shaking their grass
So step right up and put your money down
This way to Carny Town
We got a man so skinny you can see his bones
We play on his ribs like a xylophone
With a pair of spoons we get a rockin' song
You'll hear it all, in Carny Town
Hurry, hurry, hurry, the house is almost full
We got a two headed cow and that's no bull
There's a man who swallows swords and he never gets hurt
He eats razor blades for dessert
He's just about the sharpest guy around
You'll see him here, in Carny Town
Aha-ha hurry, hurry step this way
Aha-ha hurry, hurry step this way
Aha-ha hurry, hurry step this way
Aha-ha hurry, hurry step this way
Aha-ha I say we're gonna win
I said hurry up
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
When they said, you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, they said, you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
When they said, you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, they said, you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
When they said, you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
You know, they said, you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine
Whether you're riding down a highway
Or walkin' down a street
It makes no difference baby
I'm gonna love you just as mean
'Cause holdin' your little hand
Makes me feel so very nice
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you
Whether we're standin' on a doorstep
Or sittin' at a park
Or strollin' down shady lane
Or dancin' in the dark
Well I can take you in my arms
And look into your pretty eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you
Give me a cave up in the mountain
Or a shack down by the sea
And I will be in heaven honey
If you are there with me
Well kiss your pretty lips
See the love-light in your eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you
Baby I'd live deep in the jungle
And sleep up in a tree
And let the rest of the world go be
If you were there with me
Well I could love you all the time
Baby, a jungle would be fine
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you
Is your burden heavy
As you bear it all alone
Does the road you travel
Harbor danger yet unknown
Are you growing weary
In the struggle of it all
Jesus will help you
When on His name you call
He is always there hearing every prayer
Faithful and true
Walking by our side in His love we hide
All the day through
When you get discouraged
Just remember what to do
Reach out to Jesus
He's reaching out to you
Is the life you're living
Filled with sorrow and despair?
Does the future push you
With its weight and its care?
Are you tired and famished
Have you almost lost your way?
Jesus will help you
Just come to Him today
He is always there hearing every prayer
Faithful and true
Walking by our side in His love we hide
All the day through
When you get discouraged
Just remember what to do
Reach out to Jesus
Come on and reach out to Jesus
I said you reach out to Jesus
He's reaching out to you
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops fallin' soft against the window
Make believe you love me one more time
For the good times, I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
As you lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops fallin' soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
For the good times
Everybody's gone away
Said they're movin' to L.A.
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town
Some caught a freight, some caught a plane
Found the sunshine lead the rain
They said "This town will waste your time"
I guess they're right, it's wasting mine
Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
You know my heart keeps tellin' me
You're not a kid at thirty-three
Play around you'll lose your wife
Play too long you'll lose your life
Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Well listen, little lady
You're steppin' out of line
Ohh, wha'cha hurry baby
You got a lot of time
Ohh, well that's not the love you feel
It's only make believe
Ohh, watch out, you'll break the heart
You're wearing on you sleeve
Cheating with your kisses
And you think you know it all
Don't worry gonna get'chu
You're riding for a fall
Better slow it down
I see a danger sign
'Cause the way you're steppin' around
You're steppin' out of line
(Steppin' out of line)
You're steppin' out of line
Aah
You cheating with your kisses
And you think you know it all
Don't worry gonna getchu
You're riding for a fall
Better slow it down
I see a danger sign
'Cause the way you're steppin' around
You're steppin' out of line
(Steppin' out of line)
You're steppin' out of line
(Steppin' out of line)
You're steppin' out of line
Well you're steppin' out of line
Ohh
Midnight's prayers so softly whispered in
A cathedral's candle light
Bring the message of the holidays
On a snowy Christmas night
Holly reeds and hidden mistletoe
Symbols of the season's might
Joyful faces everywhere you go
On a snowy Christmas night
Give thanks for all you've been blessed with
And hold your loved ones tight
For you know the Lord's been good to you
On a snowy Christmas night
Mother Nature wears a bridal gown
For the world is dressed in white
There's a silent glow that fills the earth
On a snowy Christmas night
Give thanks for all you've been blessed with
And hold your loved ones tight
For you know the Lord's been good to you
On a snowy Christmas night
For you know the Lord's been good to you
On a snowy Christmas night
If I have wounded any soul today
If I have caused one's foot to go astray
If I have walked in my own willful way
Dear Lord, forgive
Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee
Forgive the secret sins I do not see
Oh guide, watch over me
And my keeper be
Dear Lord, Amen
Amen
How many stars are in the sky
I'll never know
What fire lights a firefly
I'll never know
What happens to this heart of mine
Each time you hold my hand
Sometimes the things we love the most
We never understand
I never thought these eyes would see
An angel's glow
What miracle brought you to me
I'll never know
What happens to this heart of mine
Each time you hold my hand
Sometimes the things we love the most
We never understand
I never thought these eyes would see
An angel's glow
What miracle brought you to me
I'll never know
What miracle brought you to me
I'll never know
I'm just a Smokey mountain boy
Come back to the hills I love
Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind
And the deep blue sky above
The closer and closer I get to home
The more excited I am
Those were the mornings I'd roll out of bed
Start the day off with a hot corn bread
Smothered in huckleberry jam
I'm just a Smokey mountain boy
Come back to the hills I love
Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind
And the deep blue sky above
I can almost hear the hounds running through the woods
Close on the trail of the hare
How I long to be with them following the hounds
a-huntin' again
Gettin' me a big old grizzly bear
I'm just a Smokey mountain boy
Come back to the hills I love
Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind
And the deep blue sky above
I traveled around and met lots of girls
No matter how many I see
I left some pretty ones behind
I know back home is where I'll find
The girl whose love is meant for me
I'm just a Smokey mountain boy
Come back to the hills I love
Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind
And the deep blue sky above
Kiss me quick, while we still have this feeling
Hold me close and never let me go
'Cause tomorrows can be so uncertain
Love can fly and leave just hurting
Kiss me quick because I love you so
Kiss me quick and make my heart go crazy
Sigh that sigh and whisper oh so low
Tell me that tonight will last forever
Say that you will leave me never
Kiss me quick because I love you so
Let the band keep playing while we are swaying
Let's keep on praying that we'll never stop
Kiss me quick just can't stand this waiting
'Cause your lips are lips I long to know
Oh that kiss will open heaven's door
And we'll stay there forevermore
Kiss me quick because I love you so
I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where those tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days
Be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days, may your days
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
If you could see me now
The one who said that he'd rather roam
The one who said he'd rather be alone
If you could only see me now
If I could hold you now
Just for a moment if I could really make you mine
Just for a while turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now
I've been too long in the wind, too long in the rain
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your loving arms again
If you could hear me now
Singing somewhere in the lonely night
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight
If you could only hear me now
Oh I've been too long in the wind, too long in the rain
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your loving arms again
I can almost feel your loving arms again
I don't want to, I don't want to
I don't want to let you know how much I want you
Don't come near me, I don't trust you
I don't trust the way you thrill me when I touch you
I was happy free and easy, I could go around 
And do the things that please me
I don't want to get tied down with a girl like you
I don't want to ... love you, but I do
I was happy free and easy, I could go around 
And do the things that please me
I don't want to get tied down with a girl like you
I don't want to ... love you, but I do
I don't want to love you, but I do
Hold me close, hold me tight
Make me thrill with delight
Let me know where I stand from the start
I want you, I need you, I love you
With all my heart
Ev'ry time that you're near
All my cares disappear
Darling, you're all that I'm living for
I want you, I need you, I love you
More and more
I thought I could live without romance
Until you came to me
But now I know that
I will go on loving you eternally
Won't you please be my own?
Never leave me alone
'Cause I die ev'ry time we're apart
I want you, I need you, I love you
With all my heart
Well, that's all right now mama
That's all right with you
That's all right now mama, just anyway you do
That's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do
My mama, she done told me, papa done told me too
"Son, that gal you're foolin' with
She ain't no good for you"
But that's all right now, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do
I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Well, then you won't be bothered with me hanging 'round your door
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do
That's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do
Well, that's all right now mama, anyway you do
I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
Same old harbor lights
That once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help it?
Tears were starting
Good-bye to golden nights
Beside the silvery seas
I long to hold you dear
And kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship
And I was on the shore
Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart keeps praying
That someday harbor lights
Will bring you back to me
Anyone could fall in love with you
Anyone who knows you as I do
Anyone could fall in love with you
And I love you my darling
Anyone could lose his heart like me
Anyone who has eyes that can see
Anyone could fall in love like me
And I love you my darling
You're the star I reached for
You're a dream so rare
You're my greatest treasure
Nothing can compare
Anyone could want you for his own
Anyone not only mine alone
Anyone could fall in love with you
And I love you my darling
Anyone could fall in love with you
And I love you my darling
All the words that I let her know
Still could not say
How much I need you so
In every way
I will hope you will guide me
And only you can do
Hold my hands down beside me
I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you dear
From the dawn of each day
To always come through dear
In your kind lovin' way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel things you do
Then you'll know how completely
I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you dear
Around the dawn of each day
To always come through dear
In your kind lovin' way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel the things you do
Then you'll know how completely
I'm counting on you
How the web was woven
In my soul, don't you know
How the web was woven
Can't get loose, can't let go
Like the weave of a spider
Wound around my heart
I'm no longer free
At last I'm where you want me
Don't you know, that's where I want to be?
Spinning 'round like a blue fly
Thoughts of you fill my head
And no matter, oh how I try
I can't sleep in my bed
I've been round for the last time
Oh, girl, what can I do?
Oh the time the web was woven,
How I fell in love, fell in love with you
Oh how many arms have held you?
And hated to let you go
How many?, Oh how many? I wonder
But I really don't, I don't wanna know
Oh how many lips have kissed you?
And set, set your soul aglow, yes they did
How many?, Oh how many? I wonder, yes I do
But I really don't want to know
So always make, make me wonder
  (Aah)
And always make, make me guess
  (Aah)
And even, you know even if I ask you
  (Aah)
Oh darling, oh don't you, don't confess
  (Aah)
Just let it, let it remain your secret
Oh for darlin', darlin' I love you so
Yes I do
No wonder, yeah no wonder, I wonder
Mmm, 'cause I really don't want, I don't wanna know
I'll be as strong as a mountain
Or weak as a willow tree
Anyway you want me
Well, that's how I will be
I'll be as tame as a baby
Or wild as the raging sea
Anyway you want me
Well, that's how I will be
In your hands my heart is clay
To take and hold as you may
I'm what you make me, you've only to take me
And in your arms, I will stay
I'll be a fool or a wise man
My darling, you hold the key
Yes, anyway you want me
Well, that's how I will be, I will be
If I should go, forget me never
Please say that you'll remember me
I pray the dreams we share together
Will shine on in your memory
Each time a star falls out of heaven
It leaves the sky a deeper blue
So if we part, forget me never
And don't forget my love for you
And don't forget my love for you
It's the feeling that I get
Looking down at my brand new baby
When I was a lad and old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog, we were both full of fun
We grew up together that way
I remember the time at the old swimmin' hold
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there, to the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped, pulled me out
As the years fast did roll, old Shep, he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
"I can do no more for him, Jim"
With hands that were trembling, I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead
He came to my side and he looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see
Old Shep, he has gone where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep, will I roam
But if dogs have a Heaven, there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home
Let's go on a moonlight swim
Far away from the crowd
All alone upon the beach
Our lips and our arms
Close within each other's reach
Will be on a moonlight swim
  (Yes, will be on a moonlight swim)
Let's go on a moonlight swim
To the raft we can race
After just a little while
I'll sit and pretend
That you're on a desert isle
With me on a moonlight swim
  (On a moonlight swim)
Though the air is cold
With kisses oh, so sweet
I'll keep you warm
So very warm from your head to your feet
Let's go on a moonlight swim
We're in love and above
There's a crazy gold balloon
That sits winking down
And inviting us to
Come on in on a moonlight swim
  (Come on in)
Though the air is cold
With kisses oh, so sweet
I'll keep you warm
So very warm from your head to your feet
Let's go on a moonlight swim
We're in love and above
There's a crazy gold balloon
That sits winking down
And inviting us to
Come on in on a moonlight swim
  (Come on in)
On a moonlight swim
On a moonlight swim
(On a moonlight swim)
Farewell, Royal High School
We'll remember you
Dear Alma Mater
We're steadfast, loyal and true
As we go onward
In the lives we lead
Your light will guide us
Your motto is our creed
We will look back fondly
At your ivy walls
Recalling precious moments
Within your hallowed halls
Farewell, Royal High School
We'll remember you
Dear Alma Mater
We're steadfast, loyal and true
Wise men said, "Only fools rush in"
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows
 to the sea
 so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with you
Look out now, I'm runnin' wild
There ain't no holding back this child
I guess you'd say I'm a son of a gun
Livin' just for a life of fun
Here's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes
Life has taught me one big lesson
Always keep the girl's guessin'
Tell 'em that you love them so
You hate to leave but you gotta go
That's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes
It's the oldest game in the world
And you gotta know how to play it
Tell her yes in so many ways
But never ever say it
And that's how I keep goin' on
Here today, tomorrow gone
That's the kind of life for me
Being free like I wanna to be
Here's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes
It's the oldest game in the world
And you gotta know how to play it
Tell her yes in so many ways
But never ever say it
Now that's how I keep goin' on
Here today, tomorrow gone
And that's the kind of life for me
Being free like I wanna to be
Here's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes
No, no, never say yes
In the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
One night of sin, yeah
Is what I'm now paying for
The things I did and I saw
Would make the earth stand still
Don't call my name
It makes me feel so ashamed
I lost my sweet helping hand
I got myself to blame
Always lived very quiet life
Ain't never did no wrong
Now I know that very quiet life
Has cost me nothing but harm
One night of sin, yeah
Is what I'm now paying for
The things I did and I saw
Would make the earth stand still
Always lived very quiet life
Ain't never did no wrong
But now I know that very quiet life
Has cost me nothing but harm
One night of sin
Is what I'm now paying for
The things I did and I saw
Would make the earth stand still
The cattle are prowling, the coyotes are howling
Way out where the doggies roam
Where spurs are a jingling, the cowboy is singing
His lonesome cattle call
He rides in the sun
'Til his days work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Singing his cattle call
For hours he would ride on the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up and slow
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call
He's browned as a berry
From riding the prairie
And he sings with an old western drawl
Singing his cattle call
COLD COLD HEAR
